       "[{'article': \"in [ 18 ] tierney and vogel for any functor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a category with finite limits and with a projective class @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is an abelian category , have constructed derived functors and investigated relationships of their theory with other theories of derived functors . \\n namely , they have shown that if @xmath1 is abelian and @xmath4 is additive , then their theory coincides with the classical relative theory of eilenberg - moore [ 7 ] , whereas if @xmath1 is abelian and @xmath4 is an arbitrary functor , then it gives a generalization of the theory of dold - puppe [ 6 ] . besides , they showed that their derived functors are naturally isomorphic to the cotriple derived functors of barr - beck [ 3 ] if there is a cotriple in @xmath1 that realizes the given projective class @xmath2 . \\n the key point in the construction of the derived functors by tierney and vogel is that , using @xmath2-projective objects and simplicial kernels , for every @xmath5 from @xmath1 a @xmath2-projective resolution can be constructed , which is an @xmath5-augmented pseudosimplicial object in @xmath1 and which for a given @xmath5 is unique up to a presimplicial homotopy ( according to the comparison theorem for @xmath2-projective resolutions ) . \\n a natural question arises about constructing a cubical analog of the theory of tierney and vogel . \\n exactly this is the purpose of this paper .    before turning to the content of the paper itself , \\n let us say few words about cubical objects and techniques . \\n as it is well known , simplicial methods are developed for long time and are successfully used in algebra and topology . with less success , but still also cubical techniques have been developed , which was initiated on one hand by the systematic use of singular cubes in the singular homology theory of topological spaces ( see , for example , [ 14 ] ) , and , on the other hand , by the papers of kan [ 12 , 13 ] which have related cubical sets to homotopy theory . \\n further research ( see e.  g. [ 1,2,4,5,8 - 11,16,17,19 ] ) has also shown that the cubical approach is interesting and important . \\n cubical objects have a number of advantages compared to the simplicial ones . \\n for example , a ( pre)cubical homotopy is given by a single morphism in each dimension , whereas a ( pre)simplicial homotopy requires `` many '' morphisms . on the other hand , \\n significant disadvantages of the cubical technique with respect to the simplicial one are also apparent . \\n for example , a cubical group , in fact even a cubical abelian group , can fail to satisfy the kan condition [ 16,17 ] . in the context of elimination of these and other disadvantages of the cubical theory , of extreme importance \\n are cubical objects with connections introduced by brown and higgins [ 4 ] . \\n these objects are cubical objects with extra degeneracies , called connections . \\n to stress importance and naturality of cubical objects with connections it suffices to name e.  g. the following three facts . \\n the singular cubical complex of any topological space has naturally defined connections . \\n next , tonks in [ 19 ] has shown that any cubical group with connections satisfies the kan condition . \\n finally , brown and higgins [ 5 ] have recently proved that the category of cubical objects with connections in an abelian category is equivalent to the category of nonnegative chain complexes in the same category .    in this paper \\n we introduce pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections , obtained from the brown - higgins structure of a cubical object with connections by suitably relaxing their identities . \\n projective precubical resolutions which we are using to construct cubical derived functors possess pseudodegeneracies and pseudoconnections and this fact is essentially used in the construction of derived functors defined by us . \\n now let us list the contents of the paper by sections . \\n in section [ prelim ] we recall the notions of presimplicial , pseudosimplicial and simplicial objects , precubical , cubical objects and cubical objects with connections , their morphisms , and the respective augmented versions of these notions . \\n we also recall the definitions of normalization functors in the simplicial setting by moore , and in the cubical setting by wiatek [ 16 ] . \\n furthermore we recall the kan cubical sets and their homotopy groups .    for any presimplicial object @xmath6 in an abelian category @xmath1 the normalized chain complex of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath7 in this paper , is a chain subcomplex of the unnormalized chain complex of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath8 . \\n the well known moore theorem says that if @xmath6 is a simplicial object in @xmath1 , then this inclusion is a chain homotopy equivalence ( in fact this is valid for any pseudosimplicial object in @xmath1 ) . on the other hand , for any precubical object @xmath9 in an abelian category @xmath1 , one has the canonical inclusion @xmath10 of chain complexes @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath1 which are cubical analogs of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see [ 16 , 17 ] ) respectively , and which functorially depend on @xmath9 . in section 2 \\n we introduce pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections and prove that @xmath13 is a chain homotopy equivalence for any pseudocubical object @xmath9 with pseudoconnections ( in particular for any cubical object @xmath9 with connections ) . \\n thus we obtain a cubical analog of the moore theorem . \\n then we establish some results which are not needed later on ; however they seem interesting by themselves . \\n let us mention some of them . \\n we indicate an alternative proof of the aforementioned brown - higgins equivalence . furthermore , we point out that this equivalence is realized by the above functor @xmath14 . \\n next , we show that if @xmath15 is a kan cubical group , then @xmath16 , the @xmath17-th homotopy group of @xmath15 , coincides with @xmath18 , the @xmath17-th homology group of @xmath19 ( note that @xmath19 and @xmath18 are defined for any cubical group @xmath15 as well ) . using this and the cubical analog of the moore theorem together with the aforementioned result of tonks \\n , we get that @xmath16 is naturally isomorphic to @xmath20 for any cubical abelian group @xmath15 with connections . \\n let @xmath1 be a category with finite limits and a projective class @xmath2 , @xmath3 an abelian category , and @xmath0 an arbitrary ( covariant ) finctor . in section 3 \\n we construct left cubical derived functors @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , as follows . \\n first we show how to build for any object @xmath5 from @xmath1 an @xmath5-augmented @xmath2-projective precubical resolution , denoted @xmath24 , by means of cubical kernels and @xmath2-projective objects \\n . then we prove the comparison theorem which in particular says that @xmath24 is unique up to precubical homotopy for a given @xmath5 . \\n furthermore , it is shown that any @xmath2-projective precubical resolution @xmath24 is in fact an augmented pseudocubical object with pseudoconnections . \\n we define @xmath25 , @xmath23 , to be the @xmath17-th homology of @xmath26 . \\n besides the comparison theorem , the fact that @xmath27 has pseudodegeneracies is crucial in proving that @xmath25 are well - defined and functorially depend on @xmath5 . \\n this contrasts with the construction of the derived functors by tierney and vogel which does not use existence of pseudodegeneracies in @xmath2-projective presimplicial resolutions ( pseudodegeneracies of @xmath2-projective presimplicial resolutions are essentially used when the theory of tierney and vogel is compared with other theories of derived functors ) . \\n further , we define @xmath28 , @xmath23 , to be the @xmath17-th homology group of @xmath29 . \\n now this construction essentially uses the fact that @xmath27 is a pseudocubical object with pseudoconnections , i.  e. , this is crucial for proving that @xmath30 are well - defined and functorial in @xmath5 . \\n the cubical analog of the moore theorem proved in the previous section shows that in fact there are isomorphisms @xmath31 , @xmath23 , which are natural in @xmath5 and @xmath4 . \\n suppose @xmath1 is an abelian category with a projective class @xmath2 , @xmath3 an abelian category , and @xmath0 an additive ( covariant ) functor . \\n then one constructs , with respect to @xmath2 , the left derived functors @xmath32 ( @xmath23 ) of @xmath4 in the sense of eilenberg - moore [ 7 ] . on the other hand , \\n since any abelian category admits finite limits , we can build @xmath2-projective precubical resolutions , and therefore can construct the cubical left derived functors @xmath33 , @xmath23 . in section 4 , using once again the cubical analog of the moore theorem , we prove that if @xmath2 is closed [ 7 ] or , more generally , is closed with respect to retracts , then there are isomorphisms @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath23 , which are natural in @xmath5 and @xmath4 . \\n we begin with the following known definitions . \\n a presimplicial object @xmath6 in a category @xmath1 is a family of objects @xmath36 together with face @xmath1-morphisms @xmath37    a morphism @xmath38 between presimplicial objects in a category @xmath1 is a family of @xmath1-morphisms @xmath39 which commute with the face operators . \\n if @xmath9 and @xmath40 are ( pseudo)simplicial objects , then the @xmath1-morphisms @xmath41 must commute with the face and ( pseudo)degeneracy operators .    a precubical object @xmath9 in a category @xmath1 is a family of objects @xmath42 together with @xmath1-morphisms @xmath43 satisfying @xmath44 the @xmath1-morphisms @xmath45 and @xmath46 are called face operators .    a cubical object @xmath9 in a category @xmath1 is a family of objects @xmath47 together with @xmath1-morphisms @xmath48 as above and @xmath49 which satisfy @xmath50 where @xmath51 . \\n the @xmath1-morphisms @xmath52 are called degeneracy operators . \\n [ [ 4 ] ] a cubical object @xmath9 in a category @xmath1 is said to have connections if there are given @xmath1-morphisms @xmath53 satisfying @xmath54    the singular cubical complex @xmath55 of a topological space @xmath9 is a cubical object with connections in the category of sets . \\n the connections @xmath56 are defined by @xmath57^n\\\\to x\\\\right)(t_1,t_2, ... ,t_{n+1})=f(t_1, ... ,t_{i-1},\\\\max(t_i , t_{i+1}),t_{i+2}, ... ,t_{n+1}).\\\\ ] ]    a morphism @xmath38 between precubical objects in a category @xmath1 is a family of @xmath1-morphisms @xmath39 which commute with the face operators . if @xmath9 and @xmath40 are cubical objects , then the @xmath1-morphisms @xmath41 must commute with the face and degeneracy operators ; and if @xmath9 and @xmath40 are cubical objects with connections , then the @xmath1-morphisms @xmath41 must commute with the faces , degeneracies and connections .    for any category @xmath1 , \\n let us denote by @xmath58 the category of presimplicial objects in @xmath1 , by @xmath59 the category of precubical objects in @xmath1 , by @xmath60 the category of cubical objects in @xmath61 , and by @xmath62 the category of cubical objects with connections in @xmath1 . \\n let @xmath1 be an abelian category , and @xmath63 the category of non - negatively graded chain complexes in @xmath1 . \\n we essentially use the normalization functor @xmath64 of wiatek [ 16 , 17 ] which is constructed as follows . \\n if @xmath65 and @xmath66 is a precubical morphism , then define @xmath67    of less importance for us is the functor @xmath68 which is defined for arbitrary abelian category @xmath1 by @xmath69 ( see [ 16 , 17 ] ) . \\n let @xmath1 be again an abelian category . \\n recall the definition of the moore normalization functor @xmath70 assume @xmath6 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 is a presimplicial morphism . \\n then @xmath73 one also has the functor @xmath74 assigning to @xmath75 its unnormalized chain complex . \\n more precisely , @xmath76    an augmented precubical ( resp . \\n presimplicial ) object in a category @xmath1 is a precubical ( resp . \\n presimplicial ) object @xmath9 in @xmath1 together with an object @xmath35 and an @xmath1-morphism @xmath77 satisfying @xmath78 ( resp . \\n @xmath79 ) . \\n such an object is denoted by @xmath80 . \\n a morphism between @xmath80 and @xmath81 is a morphism @xmath82 between @xmath9 and @xmath40 together with an @xmath1-morphism @xmath83 satisfying @xmath84 . \\n denote the category of augmented precubical ( resp . \\n presimplicial ) objects in @xmath1 by @xmath85 ( resp . \\n @xmath86 ) , by @xmath87 the category of augmented pseudosimplicial objects in @xmath1 , and by @xmath88 the category of augmented simplicial objects in @xmath1 . \\n assume @xmath1 is abelian . \\n then a nonnegative chain complex in @xmath1 augmented over @xmath35 is a nonnegative chain complex @xmath9 in @xmath1 together with an @xmath1-morphism @xmath77 satisfying @xmath89 . \\n denote the category of augmented nonnegative chain complexes in @xmath1 by @xmath90 . \\n for any abelian category @xmath1 , the functor @xmath91 , respectively the functors @xmath92 , @xmath93 extend in an obvious way to @xmath94 respectively @xmath95    let @xmath1 be an abelian category . using the shifting functor @xmath96 ( assigning to @xmath97 the nonnegative chain complex @xmath98 defined by @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) , we get functors @xmath103 and @xmath104 the restrictions of which to the category of augmented pseudosimplicial objects are used in the next section . \\n next recall [ 12 ] the definition of the homotopy groups of a kan cubical set . \\n a cubical set @xmath9 is said to be kan if for any @xmath105 , any @xmath106 and any collection of @xmath107 elements @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , satisfying @xmath112 there exists @xmath113 such that @xmath114    let @xmath9 be a cubical set , @xmath115 and @xmath108 , @xmath102 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 . \\n we write @xmath116 iff @xmath117 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 . \\n suppose now that @xmath118 is a kan cubical set with a basepoint @xmath119 . \\n let @xmath120 and define an equivalence relation @xmath121 on @xmath122 @xmath123 by @xmath124 or equivalently , by @xmath125 [ 12 , theorem 6 ] . \\n denote @xmath126 , @xmath127 . \\n let @xmath128,[y]\\\\in\\\\pi_n(x,\\\\psi)$ ] @xmath129=cl_\\\\sim(x))$ ] , @xmath102 . \\n since @xmath9 is kan , there is @xmath130 with @xmath131 clearly , @xmath132 . \\n define @xmath128\\\\bl[y]=[\\\\pa_1 ^ 1z]$ ] . \\n this definition depends only on the equivalence classes of @xmath133 and @xmath134 and , with this multiplication , @xmath135 , @xmath102 , is a group , called the @xmath17-th homotopy group of @xmath118 . \\n finally let us note that in the text we will freely make use of the freyd - mitchell embedding theorem ( see e.  g. [ 20 , p.25 ] ) when applying various results in the literature about modules to objects in general abelian categories . \\n let @xmath15 be a cubical group and define @xmath136 then :    1 . \\n @xmath137 , @xmath127 . \\n 2 .   @xmath138 , @xmath139 . \\n 3 .   @xmath140 is a normal subgroup of @xmath141 and of @xmath142 , @xmath127 . \\n let @xmath143 . by definition @xmath144 consequently , @xmath145 . \\n hence ( a ) is proved . \\n . then @xmath146 . using this we get @xmath147 . \\n hence ( b ) is proved . \\n suppose @xmath148 and @xmath149 . \\n obviously one has @xmath150 and @xmath151 . \\n this proves ( c ) . \\n thus , for any cubical group @xmath15 , @xmath152 is a chain complex of ( not necessarily abelian ) groups . \\n we call @xmath19 the moore chain complex of @xmath15 . \\n it is obvious that @xmath19 and its homology groups @xmath153 functorially depend on @xmath15 . \\n obviously , in the construction of @xmath19 one may replace @xmath15 by a precubical object @xmath9 in an abelian category ( in [ 16 ] @xmath19 is introduced for cubical objects in an abelian category ) . \\n in this case we redefine the differential @xmath154 on @xmath11 by @xmath155 . \\n then @xmath11 is a chain subcomplex of @xmath12 and one has a natural monomorphism @xmath156 . \\n + 4 mm    now let us introduce pseudocubical objects and pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections . \\n + 4 mm    a pseudocubical object @xmath9 in a category @xmath1 is a family of objects @xmath42 together with face @xmath1-morphisms @xmath157 for @xmath51 . \\n we say that a pseudocubical object @xmath9 in a category @xmath1 has pseudoconnections if there are given @xmath1-morphisms @xmath53 which satisfy @xmath158    morphisms of pseudocubical objects and pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections are defined in an obvious way , just as for cubical objects and cubical objects with connections .    for a category @xmath1 , \\n let us denote by @xmath159 the category of pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections in @xmath1 . \\n let @xmath1 be an abelian category . \\n define the functor @xmath160 as follows : @xmath161 on the other hand , we have the functors @xmath162 and @xmath163 from @xmath87 to @xmath164 . \\n one can easily see that @xmath165    let @xmath15 be a simplicial object in an abelian category @xmath1 . \\n then the normalized chain complex @xmath166 of @xmath15 is a chain subcomplex of the unnormalized chain complex @xmath167 of @xmath15 . \\n the moore theorem says that this inclusion is a chain homotopy equivalence . \\n the proof of this theorem [ 15 , p.94 ] does not use the simplicial identity : @xmath168 , @xmath169 . \\n therefore one may assert that for any augmented pseudosimplicial object @xmath6 in an abelian category @xmath1 , the natural monomorphism @xmath170 is a chain homotopy equivalence . \\n replacing now @xmath6 by @xmath171 , where @xmath9 is a pseudocubical object with pseudoconnections in @xmath1 , and using @xmath172 and @xmath173 , we get a cubical analog of the moore theorem :    [ normtheo ] let @xmath9 be a pseudocubical object with pseudoconnections in an abelian category . then the natural monomorphism @xmath156 is a chain homotopy equivalence and , therefore , @xmath174 is an isomorphism for all @xmath23 . \\n in fact @xmath156 has a natural homotopy inverse @xmath175 with @xmath176 ( see the proof of theorem 22.1 of [ 15 ] ) . \\n note that the natural monomorphism @xmath177 need not be a chain homotopy equivalence for a cubical object @xmath9 with connections in an abelian category . \\n as is known the prime examples of pseudosimplicial objects are the projective resolutions used by tierney and vogel to define their derived functors . in the next section we construct cubical analogs of tierney - vogel s projective resolutions ( in order to define our cubical derived functors ) and show that they have pseudodegeneracies and pseudoconnections . \\n the material in the rest of this section is not needed in what follows ; however we believe it is interesting for its own sake . \\n suppose that @xmath9 is a cubical object with connections in an abelian category @xmath1 . \\n then @xmath171 is an augmented simplicial object . \\n denote by @xmath178 the chain subcomplex of @xmath12 generated by the images of the degeneracies of @xmath171 . \\n since the degeneracy morphisms of @xmath171 are defined by @xmath179 , @xmath102 , @xmath180 , one has @xmath181 besides , @xmath182 and @xmath183 . \\n let @xmath9 be a cubical object with connections in an abelian category @xmath1 . \\n then :    1 . \\n @xmath184 and hence @xmath11 is isomorphic to @xmath185 . \\n the canonical projection @xmath186 is a chain homotopy equivalence .    as @xmath171 is an augmented simplicial object , one has @xmath187 ( where @xmath188 is the chain subcomplex of @xmath189 generated by the degenerate elements of @xmath171 ) , and the canonical projection @xmath190 is a chain homotopy equivalence ( see corollary 22.2 and 22.3 of [ 15 ] ) . but \\n @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 . hence ( \\n a ) and ( b ) hold . \\n suppose @xmath9 is a cubical set with connections . \\n an n - cube @xmath194 is said to be folded if there exists @xmath195 such that @xmath196 for some @xmath197 ( see [ 1 ] ) . \\n when we define the singular cubical homology @xmath198 of a topological space @xmath4 , it is necessary to factor out the degenerate singular cubes . \\n it easily follows from theorem 2.5 that the folded singular cubes can be ignored in addition when we calculate @xmath198 . \\n let @xmath1 be an abelian category . \\n restricting @xmath14 and @xmath199 to the category @xmath62 , and @xmath200 to the category @xmath88 , we get the following commutative diagram @xmath201 ^ -{m}\\\\ar[rd]_-{\\\\ol{n}}&&ch_{\\\\ge 0}(\\\\sa)\\\\\\\\ & as(\\\\sa)\\\\ar[ru]_-{\\\\wh{i}}}\\\\ ] ] in which , by the dold - kan theorem , @xmath200 is an equivalence of categories . \\n moreover , the functor @xmath202 is also an equivalence . \\n the proof is very similar to the proof of the dold - kan theorem [ 20 , p.270 ] . \\n thus we have got an alternative proof of the result by brown and higgins [ 5 ] about the equivalence of the categories @xmath62 and @xmath164 . \\n furthermore , we have pointed out the functor @xmath203 which realizes this equivalence .    in \\n what follows , for pointed kan cubical monoids @xmath15 , we will always take the unit 1 of @xmath204 as basepoint , and denote @xmath205 by @xmath16 . \\n [ moorekan ] \\n let @xmath15 be a kan cubical monoid and suppose that @xmath105 . then :    \\\\(a ) for any @xmath206 ,  @xmath128\\\\bullet[y]=[xy]$ ] . \\n \\\\(b ) @xmath16 is abelian .    to prove this proposition , we need the following well known    [ twoopers ] let @xmath207 and @xmath208 be binary operations on a set @xmath209 . \\n assume that they have units and satisfy @xmath210 for all @xmath211 . \\n then these operations coincide and @xmath212 is an abelian monoid . \\n the proofs of propositions 17.2 and 17.3 of [ 15 ] ) . using the monoid structure on @xmath15 \\n , a binary operation may be defined on @xmath16 by @xmath128*[y]=[xy]$ ] . \\n this is well - defined . indeed , \\n if @xmath206 then @xmath213 , and if @xmath214 and @xmath215 , @xmath216 , i.  e. , @xmath217 then @xmath218 i.e. , @xmath219 . \\n next , assume that @xmath128,[y],[u],[v]\\\\in\\\\pi_n(g)$ ] . by the kan condition , there are @xmath220 with @xmath221 whence @xmath222 then , by the definitions of @xmath223 and @xmath208 , we can write @xmath224\\\\bl[y]\\\\right)*\\\\left([u]\\\\bl[v]\\\\right)=[\\\\pa_1 ^ 1w_1]*[\\\\pa_1 ^ 1w_2][\\\\pa_1 ^ 1w_1\\\\cdot\\\\pa_1 ^ 1w_2]=\\\\\\\\

consequently , we conclude , by lemma [ twoopers ] , that @xmath207 and @xmath208 coincide and @xmath16 is abelian . \\n [ kanpimoore ] for any _ kan _ cubical group @xmath15 , @xmath225    let us use the following notations : @xmath226 it is evident that @xmath227 for all @xmath127 . \\n therefore , in view of proposition [ moorekan ] , it suffices to show that @xmath228 if and only if @xmath229 , @xmath230 . \\n suppose that @xmath206 and @xmath228 . \\n then @xmath231 this gives @xmath128*[y^{-1}]=[xy^{-1}]=[1]$ ] , whence @xmath128=[y]$ ] , i.  e. , @xmath228 . \\n any cubical group with connections is kan [ 19 ] . \\n combining this with theorem [ normtheo ] and proposition [ kanpimoore ] , we get    for any cubical abelian group @xmath15 with connections , @xmath16 is naturally isomorphic to @xmath20 for all @xmath23 . \\n let @xmath1 be a category and @xmath232 a sequence of @xmath1-morphisms , @xmath102 . \\n a cubical kernel of the sequence @xmath233 is a sequence

. \\n it is shown in [ 16 ] that the functor @xmath386 sends cubically homotopic morphisms to chain homotopic morphisms . \\n the proof , which we repeat here because of the completeness , shows that in fact one has    [ prechn ] let @xmath9 be a pseudocubical object and @xmath387 a precubical object in an abelian category @xmath1 , and @xmath388 precubical morphisms . if @xmath264 and @xmath389 are precubically homotopic @xmath265see theorem @xmath390 , then @xmath391 and @xmath392 are chain homotopic . \\n let @xmath393 be a precubical homotopy from @xmath264 to @xmath389 , and let @xmath394 denote the canonical monomorphism from @xmath395 to @xmath328 , @xmath127 . \\n one checks that @xmath396 , @xmath348 , @xmath127 . consequently \\n , we have morphisms @xmath397 clearly , @xmath398 further , for all @xmath102 , we have @xmath399 hence @xmath400 is a chain homotopy from @xmath391 to @xmath401 . \\n this proposition together with theorem 2.4 implies    [ prechm ] let @xmath9 and @xmath387 be pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections in an abelian category @xmath1 , and @xmath388 precubical morphisms . if @xmath264 and @xmath389 are precubically homotopic , then @xmath402 and @xmath403 are chain homotopic . \\n we are now ready to introduce cubical derived functors . \\n let @xmath1 be a category with finite limits and a projective class @xmath2 , @xmath404 an abelian category , and @xmath405 an arbitrary ( covariant ) functor . \\n we construct the left cubical derived functors @xmath406 , @xmath127 , of @xmath4 as follows . if @xmath35 , choose ( once and for all ) a @xmath2-projective resolution @xmath407 and define @xmath408 theorem 3.3 and propositions 3.4(a ) and 3.6 show that the objects @xmath25 are independent ( up to natural isomorphism ) of the resolution chosen ( if @xmath409 is a second @xmath2-projective resolution and @xmath410 a precubical morphism extending @xmath411 , then @xmath412 are isomorphisms ) . \\n moreover , by the same statements , it is immediately clear that @xmath21 are defined on morphisms and are functors from @xmath1 to @xmath404 . besides , functoriality in the variable @xmath4 is obvious . \\n similarly , in view of theorem 3.3 , corollary 3.5 and proposition 3.7 , one can define functors @xmath413 by @xmath414 it follows from theorem 2.4 that in fact there are isomorphisms @xmath415 which are natural in @xmath5 and in @xmath4 .    as one sees the construction of @xmath21 essentially uses [ resdeg](a ) , and similarly @xmath416 essentially uses [ psec ] . \\n this contrasts with the fact that the construction of the derived functors by tierney and vogel does not use existence of pseudodegeneracies in @xmath2-projective presimplicial resolutions . on the other hand , as shown in [ 16 ] , the functor @xmath417 ( see section 1 ) sends precubically homotopic morphisms of precubical objects to chain homotopic morphisms ( cf . \\n propositions [ prechn ] and [ prechm ] ) . \\n this together with theorem [ precm ] allows us to conclude that one does not need proposition [ resdeg](a ) to prove that the functors @xmath418 where @xmath27 is a @xmath2-projective precubical resolution augmented over @xmath35 , are correctly defined . \\n but in this way one obtains `` bad '' derived functors by the following reason . \\n one can easily see that @xmath419 for any @xmath250 and any @xmath23 . \\n thus in general the higher ( @xmath139 ) derived functors @xmath420 do not vanish on @xmath2-projectives , i.  e. , the crucial property of derived functors is not satisfied . \\n in particular , there is no chance for @xmath420 to coincide with the classical derived functors for additive functors @xmath4 between abelian categories . at the same time , the derived functors @xmath21 and @xmath416 certainly vanish on @xmath2-projectives for @xmath139 , and in particular coincide with the classical derived functors for additive @xmath4 , as we will show below in theorem [ coinc ] . \\n suppose that @xmath1 is an abelian category and @xmath405 an additive functor . our aim is to compare @xmath421 @xmath123 with the derived functors of @xmath4 in the sense of eilenberg -

redshift resonance has a typical comoving width @xmath172 larger than the higher - redshift resonance ( @xmath128 ) . for cmb frequency @xmath173 \\n , we get the fitting formula of @xmath155 as @xmath174 fig . \\n [ fig : mg2 ] shows @xmath175 . \\n therefore , the condition @xmath176 for @xmath177 is achieved when the comoving coherent scale of magnetic fields satisfies @xmath178 where we used @xmath179 with @xmath180 and @xmath181 . as the alp mass decreases , our constraint is valid for small - scale magnetic fields . as the alp mass decreases , \\n our constraint is valid for small scale magnetic fields , such as those expected to be produced in the qcd or electroweak phase transitions ( @xmath182 )  @xcite . \\n in this paper , we have studied resonant conversions from cmb photons to small - mass alps with primordial magnetic fields . \\n resonant conversions of cmb photons to such small - mass alps occur due to plasma effects in the dark age . \\n these resonant conversions can produce observable cmb distortions . \\n we have evaluated the resonant conversion probability between cmb photons and alps , following the method of ref . \\n in particular , we have focused on low - mass alps , @xmath183  ev . depending on cmb frequency , cmb photons suffer multiple resonant conversions to such low - mass alps . \\n using cobe firas bound on the possible cmb distortions from the black - body spectrum , we have obtained the upper limit on @xmath184 where @xmath0 and @xmath185 are the photon - alp coupling constant and the averaged primordial magnetic field strength at the present epoch . \\n our limit is @xmath186 for @xmath3 at the cmb frequency @xmath187 . \\n we have found that the cobe constraint requires fine tuned @xmath111 for @xmath188 . \\n this means that alps in this mass region with non - zero photon coupling are effectively ruled out . \\n we have also evaluated the constraint expected from pixie / prism , one of whose goals is to measure the cmb frequency spectrum precisely . compared with cobe firas , pixie / prism can improve the constraint on @xmath189 by the ratio of pixie / prism s cmb distortion sensitivity to cobe firas s one . \\n accordingly , the pixie / prism constraint is @xmath190 for @xmath3 at the cmb frequency @xmath187 . \\n the resonant conversion creates the deficit distortion . \\n this fact means that the effective temperate of residual free electron gas , which is thermally equivalent with cmb temperature before the resonant conversion , becomes higher than the effective cmb temperature after the conversion . as a result , in order to recover the thermal equilibrium state , electrons with high momenta cool by compton scatterings and ones with low momenta absorb cmb photons . \\n this signature can appear on the cmb spectrum at low frequencies  ( less than 1  ghz ) . \\n we will address this issue in the near future . \\n the current direct constraint on the photon - alp coupling for small mass is @xmath191 for @xmath192  @xcite . \\n our constraint is to the product of the photon - alp coupling constant @xmath0 and the magnetic field strength @xmath193 . \\n the constraint on @xmath194 has been also derived from studying the effect of photon - alp conversions on cmb polarization  @xcite . \\n our result shows that cobe firas constraint is comparable with this bound and pixie / prism can provide the better bound . \\n recently , the limit similar to the pixie / prism constraint , @xmath195 , has been suggested as due to the conversion _ from _ the axionic dark radiation _ to _ cmb photons  @xcite . \\n however , our work relies on the reverse process , which does not require the prior production of axionic dark radiation \\n . therefore pixie / prism can give the more robust constraint . \\n as for primordial magnetic fields , the upper bounds on primordial magnetic fields are provided by observations of cmb anisotropies  @xcite and large scale structures  @xcite . the constraint on comoving magnetic field strength with the @xmath104  mpc coherent scale is below several nano gauss . \\n therefore , if primordial magnetic fields are detected with the upper limit strength , the pixie / prism limit can give a stronger constraint on the photon - alp coupling @xmath0 stronger by roughly 5 orders of magnitude compared to the present limit for small - alp mass , @xmath196  ev  ev , then the photon coupling leads to cosmological birefringence ( e.g. @xcite ) and causes rotation of cmb polarisation . \\n limits from wmap9 @xcite translate to constraints on @xmath0 of a similar order of magnitude to those obtainable by pixie / prism for intermediate scale axion decay constants @xmath197  gev . \\n planck polarisation results should improve this further . ] .    on the other hand , \\n if in future the existence of small - mass alps were confirmed , for example by direct detection @xcite , and the photon - alp coupling constant was measured then the constraint of pixie / prism constrains primordial magnetic fields . \\n the measurement of cmb distortions by pixie / prism can then give the stronger constraint on the primordial magnetic fields than other current upper limits . \\n we thank jens chlubas for useful comments . \\n ht is supported by the doe . \\n the research of js has been supported at iap by the erc project 267117 ( dark ) hosted by universit pierre et marie curie -

mass laser interferometer detectors have been improved to a point , where they are expected to directly detect gravitational waves in the 0.1 to 1 khz frequency band through the development of advanced ligo@xcite . \\n the first gravitational wave detectors were based on the `` weber bar '' , and required the monitoring of a high-@xmath6 massive resonant system ( resonant - mass detector ) . \\n such a system will change its state of vibration due to an incident gravitational wave of matched frequency and rely on ultra - sensitive transducers to readout the vibration . \\n these transducers detect the displacement change of the system and convert it to an electronic signal . \\n since the first detector was built@xcite technology improved rapidly over the years , with major projects in italy , usa and australia@xcite . \\n these detectors necessarily operated at low temperatures , and were successfully built at high sensitivity operating at 5 k down to 100 mk . \\n the original transducers that weber used were based on piezoelectricity , and later gap modulated displacement sensors were developed based on squid readouts@xcite and low noise parametric systems@xcite . \\n these devices were optimised to detect millisecond bursts , typically produced by supernovas with strain sensitivities of order @xmath7 ( or signal strain fourier component @xmath8 strain / hz ) , but have generally been superseded by the laser interferometer detectors@xcite .    in this work \\n we aim to revive the resonant - mass detector for the first cosmic search of high frequency gravitational wave radiation based on piezoelectric quartz bulk acoustic wave ( baw ) resonators . despite dominance of the low frequency gw detection , \\n this technology opens the way to test for known and unknown high frequency sources@xcite . \\n in general high frequency gravitational waves are thought to exist over a broad range of frequencies up to @xmath9  hz , but at a reduced amplitude compared to low frequency sources sensitive to ligo . \\n such experiments could be interesting from two points of view : first , the high frequency region has physically understood processes of generation of gws , second , such experiments can be regarded as tests for many emerging theories predicting gw radiation at such frequencies . \\n the former mostly includes phenomena associated with discrete sources such as thermal gravitational radiation from stars@xcite , radiation from low mass primordial black holes@xcite , gravitational modes of plasma flows@xcite , while the latter group is built up by cosmological sources including stochastic sources in the early universe@xcite , gw background from quintessential inflation@xcite , cosmic strings@xcite , dilation@xcite , pre -

world black holes associated with extra dimensions@xcite or clouds of axions@xcite . \\n at least one of the hypothetical sources ( due to the galactic centre shadow brane ) comes within a factor 5 of the sensitivity of the single detector proposed in this work @xcite . \\n moreover , the sensitivity of the detector could be further improved via a variety of techniques to bridge this factor of 5 . \\n for example , the detector proposed in this work can be operated in the quantum limit , thus standard techniques to beat the quantum limit for the detection of a classical force can be used . other ways to increase the sensitivity would be to use a larger resonant - mass structure , or an array of detectors . \\n thus , this technique will provide a valuable upper bound on such gw sources in the mhz frequency band and also provide an avenue for possible detection .    the technological advancement which allows \\n this possibility is due to recent work on quartz bulk acoustic wave ( baw ) resonators , which have been cooled to below 20 mk with outstanding acoustic properties@xcite . \\n also , they have proven to be compatible with squid amplifiers and offer quantum limited amplification at mk temperatures@xcite . \\n the modes in these devices are naturally sensitive to gravitational waves at very high frequencies between 1 mhz to nearly 1 ghz with @xmath6-factors of order @xmath10 and approaching @xmath9 . \\n the piezoelectricity and high acoustic @xmath6-factor ensures significant `` self '' transductance of the baw resonator with high electromechanical sensitivity without the necessity of an externally added transducer . \\n these devices were originally developed for high stability frequency applications@xcite and more recently adapted at low temperatures for quantum information applications@xcite and fundamental physics tests@xcite . \\n indeed it seems like the quantum limited read out of these devices in the quantum ground state will soon be achieved . \\n temperatures are accessible where such modes will be in their ground state without the necessity of sideband cooling and near quantum limited squid and parametric amplifiers also exist at these frequencies@xcite . here , we show that a sensitive gravitational wave detector of @xmath11 strain per @xmath3 can be realised with the present day technology in the frequency range of 1 to 1000 mhz . \\n currently there is no other technology capable of measuring such high frequency gravitational waves with such sensitivity , and a range of possible high frequency sources could exist . \\n only recently an idea of detecting medium frequency gw ( @xmath12 khz ) using levitating optical resonators has been proposed@xcite . \\n in addition to that searches for gw background at @xmath13mhz have been considered with an interferometric detector@xcite . \\n the system proposed in this work can potentially provide a larger frequency range and higher sensitivity for this purpose . \\n the displacement distribution for the thickness modes of a plate resonator with curved surfaces can be calculated from the stevens -

displacement vector and @xmath105 is electrode area . \\n although , material parameters , for quartz in particular , are not known for cryogenic temperatures . \\n nevertheless , values of coupling could be derived based on impedance analysis of a baw resonator . \\n such measurements provide three system parameters specific to each mode : resonance frequency @xmath106 , quality factor @xmath107 and motional resistance @xmath108 . \\n this also can be done in an alternative representation using an electrical equivalent circuit with inductance @xmath109 , capacitance @xmath110 and resistance @xmath108 . \\n the electrical impedance of the mode @xmath78 is then given as @xmath111 . \\n since only low overtone modes are considered in the present analysis , the influence of the shunt capacitance could be neglected . \\n equation ( [ r120dd ] ) can be reduced to a simple charge form @xmath112 assuming linearity of coupling . \\n here @xmath113 is the electromechanical coupling coefficient to be determined . employing analogy between mechanical and electrical equivalent models for an acoustic resonance , it can be found that @xmath114 where @xmath115 is an effective spring

the acoustic wave distribution ( [ p016bdd ] ) . \\n the parameter @xmath118 is typically small for quartz baw devices@xcite . \\n it can be of the order of magnitude @xmath119  c@xmath120m@xmath121 , since typically @xmath122  mhz mode exhibits @xmath123 and @xmath124  ohm with about @xmath125  g mass . \\n due to its piezoelectric nature , a baw plate cavity can be directly coupled to an electronic circuit@xcite . for cryogenic operation , \\n the choice naturally falls on superconducting quantum interference devices due to their low noise . \\n the successful observation of nyqvist noise in cryogenic baw cavity has been recently demonstrated@xcite . \\n this section discusses the noise limitations associated with this detection technique . \\n it has to be noted that the same baw cavity can be probed by optomechanical methods @xcite if a mirror coating is introduced . \\n optical probing of baw quartz resonators has already been used for time - keeping and material study applications @xcite .    a typical gravitational - wave detection setup involving a resonant - mass antenna consists of three main parts : a resonant antenna , a noisy amplifier and a filter@xcite . \\n the proposed experimental setup and the equivalent circuit model are shown in fig . \\n [ f00132fs ] . the first amplification stage of a detector is based on a near - quantum - limited squid amplifier that have already been employed for dark - matter search experiments@xcite . \\n to calculate the sensitivity of the whole setup , noise analysis of the dominant noise sources attributed to the nyquist noise of the antenna and the amplifier must be considered .      in this section \\n we consider the amplifier nyquist noise acting back on the antenna . \\n the voltage noise acting back on the mode can be written as : @xmath126 where @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are input impedance , voltage and current noise of the squid amplifier and @xmath130 is the impedance of the shunt capacitance @xmath131 . \\n the corresponding spectral density of the force fluctuations ( measured in n@xmath120hz ) are @xmath132 the back action impedance @xmath133 approaches @xmath134 in the limit @xmath135 , @xmath136 . \\n to estimate frequency dependence of @xmath133 impedance , we consider typical equivalent electrical parameters of an acoustic resonance ( @xmath137  ohm , @xmath138  h , @xmath139  pf ) and input coil of the squid amplifier ( @xmath140  nh ) . from the calculations ( see fig . \\n [ f00134fs ] ) it is apparent that the backaction impedance value exactly at the mechanical resonance equals to the motional impedance of an acoustic mode @xmath108 . \\n this makes it independent of the resonance between the shunt capacitance @xmath131 and the input inductance of a squid amplifier as demonstrated in fig . \\n [ f00134fs ] ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . \\n ( solid curves ) in fractional units of @xmath108 . \\n the detuning frequency given in number of bandwidths @xmath141 is calculated for two resonance frequencies @xmath142 and @xmath143 . \\n dashed curves demonstrate the normalised impedance of motional branches of he equivalent model . \\n note that the impedance drops to @xmath108 at the mechanical resonances.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    result ( [ ff02io ] ) could be compared to the nyquist force noise of the mechanical oscillator itself . \\n the influence of these two types of noises is equal when @xmath144 which at mechanical resonance gives @xmath145 , i.e. the equivalent of noise corresponding to the mode equivalent resistance over the unit bandwidth . in other words , \\n the squid backaction noise could be neglected if it is generated over the resistance less than that of the baw mode . \\n analysing the detector equivalent circuit ( fig . \\n [ f00132fs ] , ( b ) ) , the spectral density of the signal at the system output is found as follows : @xmath146 , \\\\end{array } \\\\right . \\n \\\\label{ff02co}\\\\ ] ] where @xmath147 is the psd due to signal from the antenna and @xmath148 is due to the additive noise of the squid amplifier itself . from this relation the minimal detectable signal psd ( measured in m@xmath120hz ) is founds as @xmath149 where the flux noise of a squid amplifier @xmath150 can be as low as @xmath151 ( at @xmath152k ) with @xmath153  wb being the flux quantum@xcite . this gives flux noise @xmath150 approaching @xmath154  wb@xmath120hz . with this noise parameter and squid input inductance @xmath155nh and @xmath156  c@xmath120m@xmath121 \\n , the displacement sensitivity @xmath157 can be estimated as low as @xmath158  m@xmath159 at @xmath98  mhz and @xmath160  m@xmath159 at @xmath98  ghz . \\n note that in order to minimise this parameter , the input inductance of the squid has to be maximised . \\n similar to the case of the backaction noise , result ( [ ff04co ] ) could be compared to the intrinsic acoustic mode nyquist noise . in this case , the flux noise corresponding to the antenna nyquist noise is @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the laplace variable . \\n the last fraction of the right hand side represents the mechanical resonance transfer function . \\n the result expression can be represented in the following form : @xmath163 this result could be understood as baw resonance nyquist noise at the input of the squid amplifier measured in flux units . \\n [ f00137fs ] compares this noise with the squid noise specified by manufacturer and discussed above .    . \\n the frequency scale is given in number of resonance bandwidths @xmath164 . \\n , scaledwidth=49.0% ] \\n in the previous sections , we have estimated the spectral sensitivity of a gravitational wave antenna based on a single baw cavity . \\n remarkably the sensitivity in terms of spectral strain sensitivity can be better than the massive 700 hz to 1 khz gw detectors developed in the 1990 s @xcite but operational at mhz frequencies . \\n thus , we have shown that they are suitable for sensitive detection of gravitational waves in the mhz frequency range . \\n the advantages of this system include : 1 ) extremely high @xmath6-factors at cryogenic temperatures@xcite from 4k down to mk temperatures , 2 ) well established high precision technology , 3 ) the existence of very large number of sensitive modes that can be used to probe distinct frequency bands@xcite , 4 ) compactness , 5 ) ease of piezoelectrical coupling to squid and parametric amplifiers@xcite , 6 ) also there is the possibility of organising arrays of detectors to improve sensitivity and allow coincidence analysis , and 7 ) the possibility of designing larger cavities for lower frequency ranges . \\n it has to be emphasized that the proposed system is a multi - mode detector . due to large number of very high-@xmath6 modes with a similar sensitivity in a wide frequency range , the bandwidth of system \\n is not limited by a bandwidth of a single mode . \\n rather , the baw cavity probes the gw radiation in different sample points across the frequency range . and due to large bandwidth of a squid amplifier , all the information from all modes , will be available at the system output \\n . this fact may be important for analysis of stochastic gw background . \\n while this work estimates the sensitivity for the currently available state - of - the - art baw technology , there is room to optimise this technology for the purpose of increasing the sensitivity to gravitational waves . \\n one possibility is to arrange several baw cavities in an array . \\n this arrangement alongside with cryogenic operation ( @xmath165mk ) becomes possible due to compactness of the devices ( @xmath166  @xmath167 with a vacuum can ) . \\n although identical baw devices manufactured according to the same technological process cooled to cryogenic temperatures have slightly different frequencies ( up to tens of khz ) due to small imperfections , this may lead to finer frequency coverage of the incoming gravitational signal . also , due to the fact that the quartz baw technology is already well established , it would be possible to create a large network of such detector arrays in different laboratories all over the world . \\n this international network of gw detectors may be used to exclude false detection via coincidence analysis@xcite . \\n another possibility is to design a special upscaled baw cavity for lower frequency range . \\n it has been recently propose to use high quality baw quartz resonators as mass standards@xcite . \\n although manufacturing of such device is associated with considerable technological difficulties , the existence of it is very beneficial for standard keeping applications allowing not only more accurate mass standard but also signal transferring due to mass lock to frequency . \\n this 1-kg standard will have a significantly lower frequency around @xmath13 khz range , but augmented active mass a least @xmath168 times that is beneficial for the sensitivity . in the same time , quality factor of such device at cryogenic temperature can not be reliably predicted , although it is generally observed that larger mass systems exhibit higher values of the @xmath6-factor@xcite . \\n so , @xmath6-factors in the range @xmath0 can be expected . \\n moreover , as the authors@xcite suggest the mass standards in different laboratories can be connected in a synchronised network that replicates the idea of the large network of baw cavity based gw detector arrays . \\n one of the motivation for the development of the cryogenic baw cavity technology is related to the field of engineered quantum systems . \\n indeed , the baw systems have proven to have the highest @xmath6-factor at the ground state among mechanical systems@xcite . in the same time , these devices are the largest objects ( gram scale ) that have been cooled to the ground state with the masses well above the plank mass . \\n so , baw technology has potential ability to the quantum mechanics and the theory of general relativity under the same experimental framework@xcite . \\n the authors thank serge galliou for his useful discussions on baw resonators and maurice van putten for useful discussions on detecting gravitational radiation at high frequencies . \\n this work was supported by the australian research council grant no . \\n

       " {'article': \"groups and clusters of galaxies are key targets for studying the evolution of galaxies and large - scale structures . in the local universe thousands of clusters are known , but at high redshift ( @xmath10 ) only few clusters have been identified due to the challenge of discriminating a distant cluster from the abundant foreground galaxies . \\n a few high - redshift clusters have been found via x - ray observations of a hot intra - cluster medium up to @xmath11 ( mullis et al 2005 , bremer et  al . \\n 2006 , stanford et  al . \\n 2006 , fang et al . \\n clusters up to this redshift range have also been found by searching for galaxy overdensities in wide - area optical - infrared surveys , for instance the _ \\n spitzer_-irac shallow survey ( stanford et  al .  2005 , eisenhardt et al . \\n 2008 ) , the ukidss ultra - deep survey ( van breukelen et  al . \\n 2006 ) , hirocs / cosmos ( zatloukal et  al . \\n 2007 ) , and the _ spitzer _  first look survey ( muzzin et  al . \\n 2008 ) .    an alternative way to find high - redshift clusters is to use radio sources as signposts . \\n luminous radio sources occur in massive galaxies ( @xmath1210@xmath13@xmath14 , seymour et  al . \\n 2007 ) , which according to the hierarchical formation model represent mass assembly peaks of the early universe . as such \\n , they are expected to trace overdense regions and therefore cluster formation sites . \\n the invaluable advantage of searching for clusters around radio sources is that one knows the redshift to search and therefore one can limit the observational effort . \\n searches around very - high - redshift ( @xmath15 ) radio sources have found an excess of lyman@xmath16-emitting galaxies ( kurk et  al .  2000 , miley et  al . \\n 2004 , venemans et  al . \\n these proto - clusters show a rather large projected extent and only a loose concentration , consistent with clusters that are forming but not yet virialized ( intema et  al . \\n 2006 , zirm et

\\n radio sources has been reported ( best 2000 , snchez & gonzlez - serrano 2002 , stern et  al .  2003 , toft et  al . \\n 2003 , wold et  al . \\n 2003 , zirm et  al . \\n these eros could be high - redshift passive ellipticals or dust - reddened star - forming galaxies . \\n this ambiguity leaves open the question of whether the giant ellipticals were already in place at these redshifts , implying a formation redshift larger still , or whether the eros are starbursts and we are probing the epoch at which the cluster ellipticals formed .    using the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( werner

rayleigh - jeans tail , while dusty starbursts may in principle show enhanced 24@xmath1 m emission . \\n this makes the survey particularly well - suited to identify massive ellipticals and dusty starbursts . \\n this paper presents first results from a pilot study of the quasar 3c270.1 at @xmath0 , combining our _ spitzer _ data with @xmath2- and @xmath3-band maps . \\n distances and ages in this paper are based on a @xmath22cdm cosmology with @xmath23  km / s / mpc , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \\n the _ spitzer _ maps of 3c270.1 were obtained using the instruments irac ( 3.68.0@xmath1 m ,

and 5.8@xmath1 m northeast and at 4.5@xmath1 m and 8.0@xmath1 m southwest of the central field containing the quasar . \\n the maps allow us to detect sources down to @xmath44@xmath1jy ( 3@xmath6 ) at

of the limited sensitivity ( 100@xmath1jy ) and small size ( 1@xmath275@xmath262@xmath18 ) , this map does not provide useful constraints for the cluster search . \\n therefore , the 16@xmath1 m data are not further considered here . ] \\n complementary @xmath2- and @xmath3-band images were obtained at the 6.5-m mmt using megacam ( 30@xmath18 fov , mcleod et  al . \\n 2006 ) and swirc ( 5@xmath18 fov , brown et  al . \\n the @xmath2- and @xmath3-bands ( centered at 0.89 and 1.05@xmath1 m , respectively ) bracket the 4000    break at redshift @xmath0 . \\n sensitivities better than 1@xmath1jy were achieved at @xmath2- and @xmath3-band under good seeing conditions ( fwhm @xmath17 1@xmath28 ) with exposure times of 40 and 90  min , respectively . \\n the @xmath2-band image covers the irac comparison fields , but the @xmath3 image does not . at galactic latitude @xmath29 \\n , foreground extinction is negligible ( @xmath30  mag ) . \\n the images were reduced using interactive analysis tools . \\n the irac mosaics were corrected for the residual images that arise from prior observations of bright sources by making object - masked , median - stacked coadds with all the science frames and then subtracting them from the science frames prior to final coadding . \\n thus , we can be sure there are no faint spurious signals in the irac mosaics arising from prior observations . for irac \\n , we used the basic calibrated data products ( bcd , version s16 ) and coadded them to 0869 pixels using version 4.1.2 of iracproc ( schuster et  al . \\n this optimally handles the slightly undersampled irac psf in order to assure accurate point - source photometry . for mips , we used custom routines to modify the version s17 bcd files to remove instrumental artifacts ( e.g. , residual images ) before shifting and coadding to create the final mosaics . \\n the megacam and swirc frames were reduced using standard proceduresmashby / megacam / megacam_frames.html for megacam . ] . \\n the 3.6@xmath1 m image shows more sources than any other , and we used it as the source detection image for constructing a multi - band catalog . in the central 4@xmath18 @xmath26 4@xmath18 with optimal depth , \\n 274 objects are detected at 3.6@xmath1 m , with 272/202/212 of them being also detected at 4.5/5.8/8.0@xmath1 m at shorter wavelength , 184 ( 150 ) of the 3.6 @xmath1 m sources are detected at @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , and 143 at both @xmath2 and @xmath3 . \\n the sources were extracted and matched using the sextractor tool ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . \\n details are described in appendix  [ appendix_a ] . \\n the photometric uncertainties are typically less than 10% but increase for the faintest sources . \\n the region of 3c270.1 has also been mapped with the _ sloan digital sky survey _ \\n ( sdss , dr6 ) . about 35 relatively bright sdss sources are identified with foreground galaxies and stars . \\n these objects are excluded from the following discussion . \\n in addition , we found an archival hubble space telescope wfpc2 snapshot image of 3c270.1 in the f702w passband ( 600s exposure time , pi w.  sparks , lehnert et  al . \\n 1999 ) . because of the limited spatial coverage and sensitivity ( 0.6@xmath1jy ) , we did not use the f702w photometry for finding potential cluster members \\n however , the hst image enables us to inspect the morphology of a few of the sources to determine whether they are pointlike or extended and to look for rest - frame uv excesses . \\n cluster galaxies around 3c270.1 should lie at the redshift of the quasar . \\n we determined photometric redshifts @xmath31 by fitting the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the 184 galaxies detected at @xmath2 with two basic templates , an elliptical galaxy and a dusty starburst galaxy . except 3c270.1 itself . ] for the elliptical galaxy , we used ngc221 , which has a strong 4000  break . the ngc221 spectral template from kinney et  al . \\n ( 1996 ) , covering the rest - frame wavelength range 3000 - 8000 , was smoothly extrapolated to longer wavelengths by a 4000k blackbody . for the starburst galaxy template \\n , we used the ultra - luminous infrared galaxy arp220 with photometry from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) and the _ sloan digital sky survey _ \\n ( sdss , dr6 ) and mid - ir spectra from _ spitzer_/irs . \\n we also tested the dust - reddened star - forming galaxy template m82 , but the results were similar to those for arp220 ( differences in @xmath31 less than @xmath32 ) , and therefore we present only the arp220 results . \\n the accuracy of photometric redshifts can be estimated , for instance , from the spitzer wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ) , which has spectroscopic redshifts available for many of its sources . in swire , 7 filters ( 5 optical and 2 irac ) were sufficient to discriminate between 8 templates ( ranging from blue to red galaxy types ) and to determine @xmath31 with an rms of @xmath33 ( rowan - robinson et al . \\n we have fewer filters than swire , but our task is easier because we only have to determine whether the photometry is consistent with @xmath0 or not . \\n furthermore , we consider only extremely red sources and only two templates and therefore suggest that we can reach accuracy similar to that of swire . at @xmath34 , an accuracy ( rms ) of about 4% \\n corresponds to @xmath32 . \\n this is much larger than the expected redshift dispersion within a cluster ( @xmath35 ) . \\n while the seds can provide cluster galaxy candidates within appropriate redshift bins around @xmath36 , confirmation of a cluster will require spectroscopic redshifts of at least a sample of the candidates . \\n error bars . the mips 24@xmath1 m data point is marked with a filled circle , too ; in the upper panel ( elliptical source ) \\n it is a 3@xmath6 upper limit , in the lower panel ( dusty starburst source ) it is a 2@xmath6 detection also visible on the map . \\n the horizontal bar indicates the 24@xmath1 m pass band for comparison with the silicate absorption feature . \\n hst photometry is marked with an open circle ; it is not available for the dusty starburst source . \\n solid lines show the elliptical galaxy ( ngc  221 ) fit for the source in the upper panel and the dusty starburst ( arp  220 ) fit for the galaxy in the lower panel . \\n dotted lines show the alternative template for each galaxy . \\n the upper and lower panel shows object numbers 23 and 3 , respectively , as listed in table[table_1 ] ) . ] \\n error bars . \\n the sources are detected only in the @xmath2-band ( in the lower panel also in the @xmath3-band ) and at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m , but the upper limits at 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m help to constrain the redshift fits . as in fig . \\n [ fig_seds_good ] , the upper panel shows a source ( object 11 ) which is preferably fit by the elliptical template and the lower panel one ( 29 ) fit by the starburst template . \\n the dotted and dashed lines show the preferred templates at different redshifts ( indicated in the figure ) , showing that the accuracy of the photometric redshifts should be @xmath37 . ] \\n figures  [ fig_seds_good ] and [ fig_seds_poor ] show examples of seds and template fits to cluster galaxy candidates . \\n the most striking sed features are the steep rise from @xmath2- to @xmath3-band and beyond and the decline between 3.6 and 8.0@xmath1 m . \\n the slopes of these features determine the redshift . \\n we performed the template fits over a grid in redshift ( dz = 0.01 ) and intensity . for a red \\n sed with @xmath38 , the chi square contour plots exhibit a sharp minimum , suggesting that for a given template the achievable accuracy of @xmath31 is about @xmath32 . as illustrated in fig . \\n [ fig_seds_poor ] , even for seds with fewer than six data points the accuracy of @xmath31 should be not worse than @xmath39 . \\n therefore , we have chosen as cluster galaxy candidates the 29 objects for which either the elliptical or the starburst template yields @xmath40 . \\n the basic conclusions on the clustering of eros around 3c270.1 remain unchanged for other ranges @xmath41 between 0.15 and 0.25 . \\n usually the 0.98.0@xmath1 m seds can be fitted very well with both the elliptical and the starburst template . \\n both templates are extremely red , and therefore no other galaxy type is likely to fit the seds . \\n the examples in figures  [ fig_seds_good ] and [ fig_seds_poor ] illustrate the ability to identify the two galaxy types at @xmath42 . \\n the resulting fit parameters for the 29 cluster candidates are listed in table  [ table_1 ] . \\n the photometric redshifts differ systematically for the elliptical and starburst templates . on average , @xmath43 is higher by 0.27 @xmath44 0.1 than @xmath45 . among the 29 cluster candidates , \\n the elliptical template yields better fits ( smaller chi square values ) for 22 sources ( 75% , table  [ table_1 ] ) . \\n all of these sources lie in the redshift bin @xmath46 . among the remaining 7 cluster candidates , those 3 sources which favor the starburst fit lie in the redshift bin @xmath46 , too . \\n these sources have @xmath47 ( object numbers 3 , 5 and 29 in table  [ table_1 ] ) . \\n the remaining 4 sources ( object numbers 11 , 14 , 17 and 28 ) are not detected at 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath1 m , and they do not clearly favor the starburst template , so that  as ellipticals  they are cluster galaxy candidates . \\n cccccccc object & ra j2000 & dec j2000 &

redder than this color range are probably at larger redshift ( @xmath53 ) , while bluer sources are consistent with being either foreground objects or unreddened star - forming galaxies at the quasar redshift . \\n our eros with @xmath54 ( corresponding to @xmath55>5$]mag in the vega system ) are likely to also obey the standard ero definition of @xmath19mag ( cf . \\n wilson et  al . \\n 2004 ) .

candidates versus projected distance from centroid ( the triangle in fig . \\n [ fig_sky ] ) . \\n the dotted line indicates the mean surface density in the two control fields . ] \\n figure [ fig_sky ] shows the sky distribution of the cluster candidates . spreading over a diameter of more than 2 , they form at most a loose concentration around the quasar , indicating a proto - cluster rather than a virialised , concentrated system . \\n the peak density appears to lie @xmath430@xmath28 to the east of 3c270.1 , but it is difficult to be precise with so few galaxies . \\n the 3c270.1 proto - cluster is larger in angular size than the x - ray clusters at @xmath11 and @xmath59 found by mullis et  al . \\n ( 2005 ) and bremer et  al . \\n these clusters have an extent of less than 1  in both their galaxy distributions and their x - ray sizes . \\n we have also analyzed the two comparison fields taken with irac and covered by the megacam @xmath2 image ( but not the swirc @xmath3 image ) . \\n details of the analysis are described in appendix  [ appendix_b ] . \\n the surface density of possible @xmath60 galaxies is less than about 18 objects in each control field of area 15.2  arcmin@xmath61 ( 1.2 per arcmin@xmath62 ) . \\n thus , in the redshift range @xmath63 , the central field surrounding the quasar shows an excess of at least about @xmath64 sources , i.e. , 60% over the comparison fields . \\n figure [ fig_radius ] shows the radial surface density plot of the 29 eros in the redshift range @xmath63 . \\n the surface density peaks inside the central 50  radius and declines steadily with increasing distance down to the surface density of the control fields . \\n this provides further evidence that there is an excess of @xmath65 galaxies near 3c270.1 . \\n the radial overdensity is also present when using circles around the centroid east of the quasar position . \\n existing x - ray data on 3c270.1 are inconclusive about the presence of a cluster . \\n the quasar itself is clearly detected as a point source in our 10  ks chandra data ( wilkes et al . \\n , in preparation ) . \\n weak extended x - ray emission ( @xmath1720 ) is also present , but most of the counts come from the position of the southern radio lobe or from between the northern radio lobe and the quasar . \\n rosat data ( 19.3  ks , 1993 may ) show a strong detection of 3c270.1 , but at rosat resolution not only is there no way to separate cluster gas emission from quasar emission , but the emission is also heavily blended with that of unrelated qso b1223 + 338b located 08 away . \\n , this qso does not affect the clustering evidence discussed here . \\n ] we found no xmm observations . \\n longer chandra exposures will be needed for a definitive detection of any x - ray emission from cluster gas . \\n the cluster galaxy candidates have an absolute rest - frame magnitude @xmath66 ( ab system ) . \\n an @xmath7 galaxy at @xmath67 has @xmath68 ( as determined from observations at @xmath69 by de  propris et  al . \\n thus only the most luminous cluster galaxy candidates are detected on our maps . \\n the galaxies are either giant ellipticals or dust - reddened starbursts . if giant ellipticals , most of their stellar mass has been formed at even higher redshift , but they may harbor some ongoing star - formation  it would be relatively weak with respect to the already existing stellar mass but could show up at rest uv wavelengths . \\n if dusty starbursts , they would have to be at least three times more luminous in the near - infrared than the ulirg arp220 , indicating that a large stellar mass has already formed during an earlier episode . \\n the distinction between ellipticals and dusty starbursts is difficult to make at rest wavelengths shorter than 1@xmath1 m using photometry only , albeit possible with adequate wavelength coverage ( pozzetti & mannucci 2000 ) . at @xmath70 , \\n the six data points of our seds cover about rest wavelength 0.33@xmath1 m . \\n as mentioned in sect.[sect_candidates ] , 75% of the seds are better fitted by the elliptical than the starburst template . in principle , \\n additional sensitive photometry at rest wavelengths longer than 10@xmath1 m could improve the starburst \\n elliptical distinction ( stern et  al .  2006 ) . at @xmath0 , \\n unfortunately , the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate absorption enters the 24@xmath1 m band , reducing the potential to detect the powerful mir emission of starbursts . apart from 3c270.1 itself , \\n there is only one cluster candidate with a marginal ( 2@xmath6 ) detection at 24@xmath1 m ( fig.[fig_seds_poor ] ) . \\n its sed provides evidence for a dust - enshrouded starburst . while only elongated on the @xmath3-band image , on the @xmath2-band image this galaxy appears as a double source with 08 ( @xmath47kpc ) separation ; for determining @xmath31 we have used the combined @xmath2-band photometry . \\n this source is not covered by the hst image ( fig . \\n [ fig_sky ] ) . \\n because the @xmath2-band image is limited in spatial resolution , we have also inspected the morphology of the sources seen on the hst snapshot image . \\n the hst frame covers 15 potential cluster galaxies ( fig . \\n [ fig_sky ] ) , 9 of which are detected . \\n all 9 are extended , ruling out the ( remote ) possibility that they might have been brown dwarfs . \\n figure  [ fig_hubble_stamps ] shows the four sources detected in the f702w filter with photometric accuracy better than 5@xmath6 . \\n the seds of these galaxies are best fit with the elliptical template . \\n they have a regular shape , and none of them shows a peculiar morphology . \\n this argues against starburst galaxy pairs and in favor of an evolved elliptical population . \\n the remaining five of the 9 hst - detected sources are too faint to draw stringent morphological conclusions .    ) . \\n the contours are linearly spaced in steps of 10% of the peak flux value ( 0% , 10% , ... \\n arrows indicate the orientation of each panel . ] \\n the hst f702w photometry is of limited use because of the short exposure time , but six of the nine detected sources appear to show a rest - frame uv excess above the elliptical template ( fig . \\n [ fig_seds_poor ] ) . \\n this indicates some level of ongoing star formation activity . \\n however , at rest wavelengths around 1@xmath1 m this activity appears to be outshone by large numbers of already - evolved stars . \\n having so many as @xmath411 galaxies brighter than @xmath7 would be very high for a local cluster , but passive evolution will cause these galaxies to become fainter by something like 3  mag and thus an age of 10  gyr at @xmath71 . ] by @xmath71 to become comparable to today s cluster ellipticals . \\n thus the photometric data are compatible with the existence of a cluster . \\n high redshift radio sources are predicted to serve as signposts for galaxy clusters in the early universe . in a pilot study using sensitive , large maps from the _ spitzer space telescope _ and the 6.5-m mmt \\n , we find a clustering of red galaxies around the @xmath0 quasar 3c270.1 :    * photometric redshifts identified 29 galaxies consistent with the quasar s redshift . \\n while moderate clustering is evident in both the radial surface density of these objects and in their numbers with respect to nearby control fields , the sky distribution of the eros suggests a loose , not - yet - virialized protocluster . \\n deep , high - angular - resolution x - ray observations are required to see whether hot intra - cluster gas is present or not . * \\n the cluster - candidate galaxies have @xmath55 $ ] colors indicative of extremely red objects ( eros ) . \\n they may be either dusty starbursts or elliptical galaxies with little ongoing star formation . \\n the sed fits favor the majority of the potential cluster members being passive ellipticals , and this is consistent with the four objects with good hst images having undisturbed morphology . in some cases \\n the hst photometry reveals a rest - frame uv excess over the elliptical template , consistent with modest on - going star formation and/or nuclear activity in these galaxies , but they must have formed the bulk of their stars at redshifts @xmath121.53 . \\n this pilot study demonstrates that the _ spitzer_/ irac maps provide an efficient way to search for clustering of red galaxies around high redshift radio sources , but accurate redshifts and the nature of the galaxies have to be confirmed with additional spectroscopy and/or deep far - infrared imaging with the _ herschel space observatory_. the ongoing investigation of all 64 high - redshift 3cr sources will result in a homogeneous database of considerable cosmological impact . \\n this work is based in part on observations made with the _ \\n spitzer space telescope , _ which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california

sextractor tool ( bertin & arnouts 1996 , version 2.5 ) . \\n this tool is able to identify sources via a tree structure algorithm , provide their total magnitudes , and , if a saddle point is present in their profile , to deblend components via a multi - isophotal analysis . \\n photometry is derived using automatically adjusted apertures ( option mag - auto ) following kron s first moment algorithm ( kron 1980 , infante 1987 ) . in case \\n close neighbours are found , the components are iteratively deblended , with the photometric uncertainty of the faint companion reaching 25% in the worst cases ( beard et al . \\n 1991 ) .    in a first step we adjusted the sextractor parameters for each image ( single - image mode ) . \\n the parameters are , for instance , noise threshold and minimum number of connected pixels defining a source . \\n the mmt z- and y - band images had a seeing of about 09 ( fwhm ) , the irac psf has fwhm between 14 at 3.6 \\n @xmath1 m and 17 at 8.0  @xmath1 m . \\n typical kron radii of the sources ( containing 90% of the flux ) are about 34 arcsec in all filters ( except 24  @xmath1 m ) , so that the psf differences play a minor role ( @xmath74 ) , and the @xmath2- and @xmath3-band photometry  as computed by sextractor  needs no aperture correction .- band photometry was calibrated with the z - band image of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , dr6 ) , including a ( very small ) color term to account for the similar but nonetheless different bandpasses . \\n our @xmath3-band photometry was calibrated with interpolated total magnitudes from sdss and 2mass . ] for the irac photometry , however , the absolute photometric calibration refers to an aperture of 12 , so we applied standard aperture corrections ( 530% ) to derive the final photometry of the sources , all of which are essentially unresolved . \\n the very few sources detected at 24  @xmath1 m are well separated , so that clean photometry could be derived without need for aperture correction .    in a second step , \\n we ran sextractor in double - image mode on the 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  irac maps , using as primary the 3.6 @xmath1 m map because it contains more sources than any other irac map . \\n the double - image mode mode is able to identify , for instance , for a 3.6  @xmath1 m detection also the corresponding 4.5  @xmath1 m source , even if it was not detected in single - image mode . \\n the double - image mode enabled us to detect essentially all 3.6 @xmath1 m sources at 4.5  @xmath1 m ( 272 of 274 sources ) . \\n the detection rate at 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m was lower ( 202 and 212 sources , respectively ) . \\n we determined the 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m upper flux limits ( @xmath757@xmath1jy ) from the break of the flux histograms of the detections . in case of non - detections and clean regions we used this flux value as the 3@xmath6 upper limit . \\n sextractor was run separately on the @xmath2 image , and the @xmath2 and irac source lists were matched with a search radius of 1.5 . \\n this should produce good identifications because no two irac sources are closer together than 3 . to check further \\n how far confusion plays a role , we counted the number of mmt sources within a radius of 3  around each irac source . by far most sources ( @xmath1290% ) \\n are unambiguously matched to a single @xmath2 source . \\n of 274 irac sources in the quasar field , 18 ( 6.6% ) have two @xmath2 counterpart , and one even has three . \\n the control fields show about the same statistics : 9 double @xmath2 counterparts ( 4.4% ) out of 205 irac sources in the 3.6  field and 10 double counterparts ( 6.0% ) out of 167 irac sources in the 4.5  field . \\n thus , the fraction of confused sources is small and comparable for control and quasar fields , and therefore we do not expect that the clustering results are significantly affected by confusion . to avoid any possible complication , we have omitted from the analysis all sources ( 47% ) with two or more @xmath2 counterparts found by sextractor . \\n the starburst cluster candidate galaxy ( object number 3 in table  [ table_1 ] ) remained in the sample because sextractor treated it as a single source . \\n most likely the saddle between the two components is not deep enough for sextractor to split them despite the source s visual appearance on the @xmath2 image as a 08 double . \\n the quasar field has photometry in six filters , two mmt and four irac bands . \\n but the two control fields have photometry in only three filters , in @xmath2 and two irac bands : 3.6 and 5.8  @xmath1 m in control field 1 , 4.5 and 8.0  @xmath1 m in control field  2 . \\n this makes the uncertainties on the photometric redshifts larger , and therefore comparison within the same redshift bin appears not to be straightforward . \\n furthermore , in the central field , the source detection rate at 4.5  @xmath1 m is lower than at 3.6  @xmath1 m , so that for a fair comparison the number of candidates in control field  2 has to be corrected for . in order to facilitate the comparison \\n , we used the colors @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath76 $ ] and counted the number of candidates in the respective color bins . \\n control field 1 : the colors of the elliptical and starburst template , when redshifted to @xmath0 , are @xmath77 = 25 and 39 , respectively . in the color range \\n @xmath52 we found 28 and 17 sources for the quasar and the control field , respectively ( fig . \\n [ fig_cm ] ) . with regard to the low number statistics , these values are consistent with the 29 and 16 sources in the quasar and the control field , having @xmath40 ( denoted as sed candidates in fig . \\n [ fig_cm ] ) . \\n this leaves an excess of 11 colour and 13 sed  selected sources in the quasar field . \\n control field 2 : the colors of the elliptical and starburst template , redshifted to @xmath0 , are @xmath78 = 24 and 43 , respectively . \\n guided by these `` expectation values '' and the actual @xmath76 $ ] distribution of the candidates in the quasar field , we selected a color range of @xmath79 ( fig . \\n [ fig_cm_2 ] , top ) . \\n now we considered the fields , where the 4.5  @xmath1 m source list was created using the single - mode sextractor option , i.e. , not making use of the 3.6  @xmath1 m information in the quasar field . \\n we found 24 and 14 color - selected candidates for the quasar and the control field , respectively ( fig . \\n [ fig_cm_2 ] , middle and bottom ) . \\n these values are consistent with the corresponding numbers for sed - selected candidates of 23 and 12 in the quasar and the control field , respectively . because the quasar field contains more cluster galaxy candidates , 29 via color and 29 via @xmath31 ( fig . \\n [ fig_cm_2 ] , top ) , we have scaled up the number of candidates in the control field by the factors 29/24 for the color - candidates and \\n 29/23 for the sed - candidates . \\n this results in 17 colour- and 15 sed - selected candidates . \\n this leaves an excess of 12 ( @xmath80 ) colour- and 14 ( @xmath81 ) sed - selected sources in the quasar field . \\n beard s.m . , \\n

       " {'article': 'the ( , ; hereafter , the ) is one of the first infrared sources discovered with an optical bipolar nebulosity @xcite . \\n this object , usually referred to as a proto - planetary nebula ( @xcite ) , consists of the central star in the post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) phase and the physically - detached circumstellar shell , which is a consequence of mass loss during the preceding agb phase . \\n while agb mass loss is qualitatively understood dust - driven , the exact physical mechanisms of the structure formation in the circumstellar shell are still not understood completely . \\n the is known for its signature bipolar lobes and rather circular concentric arcs @xcite . \\n while there are about a dozen sources with such arcs , the is known to possess the largest number of arcs ( @xmath4 ; @xcite ) . \\n these concentric arcs are qualitatively perceived as manifestations of some kind of mass loss modulations that took place during the early agb phase . \\n however , the deduced temporal intervals do not match with any of the known theoretical temporal intervals ( e.g. , thermal pulsing and surface pulsations of agb stars ; @xcite ) .    one of the direct methods to understand the dynamics of the circumstellar structure formation is to perform a differential proper - motion analysis and _ measure _ the amount of relative translational motion of specific shell structures . \\n we performed such an analysis for the bipolar lobes and the equatorial structures of the using nicmos imaging - polarimetry data taken with a 5.5-yr baseline and found that ( 1 ) the lobes expanded linearly ( i.e. , the expansion velocity linearly proportional to the distance to the expansion center ) , ( 2 ) the distance to the was @xmath5  pc , and ( 3 ) the object ( star and nebula ) itself experienced its own proper motion at ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) mas yr@xmath2 @xcite . \\n however , we were unable to measure differential proper - motion of the concentric arcs because the nicmos field of view was too small and the surface brightnesses were too weak is in the near - ir . \\n @xcite performed the latest attempt using acs / hrc and wfc3/uvis images with a 6.65-yr baseline . \\n they reported ( 1 ) a uniform expansion of the bipolar lobes by 2.5% and ( 2 ) radial motion of the arcs by 007 . \\n however , their analysis was limited to the central @xmath8 and lacked background reference sources to properly align multi - epoch images . \\n hence , they were unable to confirm the bulk motion of the nebula and _ assumed _ that the shell structures expanded symmetrically . \\n in this work , we performed differential proper - motion measurements of the concentric arcs using the archived imaging - polarimetry data from wfpc2 and acs / wfc , exploiting the data set s largest field of view , longest exposure time , and longest temporal baseline to overcome the deficiencies of the previous analyses . \\n below , we describe the data set and reduction procedure (  2 ) , present the reduced imaging polarimetry data , differential proper - motion measurements , and results of our analysis (  3 ) , and summarize our finding (  4 ) . \\n we used the archived data of the in the f606w band with polarizers taken with wfpc2 ( gto / wf2 - 6221 ; pi : j.  trauger ) on 1995 july 17 ( epoch 1 , hereafter ) and acs / wfc ( cal / acs-9586 ; pi : w.  sparks ) on 2002 october 16 ( epoch 2 , hereafter ) , which provide a 7.25-yr baseline ( table [ obs ] ) . \\n we reduced the data using the pyraf / stsdas multidrizzle package version 3.13 @xcite to process the multi - program data into a common frame of reference . after removing cosmic - ray hits from the pipeline - calibrated data using _ \\n ( @xcite ; there was only one exposure with each of the three wfpc2 polarizers ) , we performed two rounds of multidrizzle processes to refine the image alignment by using background point sources as spatial anchors .    in the end , we generated two sets of three polarizer images for a @xmath9 field at the @xmath10 pix@xmath2 scale centered at the catalog coordinates of the ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ; @xcite ) . \\n finally , these polarizer images were combined into two sets of stokes images via matrix transformations for each of the wfpc2 and acs polarizers as described by @xcite and @xcite , respectively . \\n we measured the amount of shift for each background source and rejected those that shifted more than two-@xmath13 of the distribution : after this exercise 31 sources were adopted as stationary spatial anchors . because the was imaged near the center of the instrument arrays ( central @xmath14 for wfpc2/wf and @xmath15 for acs / wfc ) these anchors are not affected by the geometric distortion , which may contribute to false proper motions near the aperture edges . \\n the accuracy of alignment was assessed by a residual vector root - mean - square offset computed from the gaussian centroid positions of these 31 spatial anchors and determined to be as good as 0.36 pix ( 0018 ) . \\n the stokes _ i _ images ( figs .  [ figimages]a , b ) are the total flux images at the broad v band in the ab magnitude system @xcite . \\n these maps show the signature bipolar lobes plus the searchlight beams as well as the concentric arcs . \\n the two - epoch aperture photometry revealed that the total integrated flux of the decreased by @xmath16 over 7.25  yrs , while the individual fluxes of the n and s lobes decreased by 34% and 41% , respectively ( table [ photom ] ) . \\n @xcite reported similar but smaller flux variations , with the n lobe faded more than the s lobe ( by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ) , over 6.65-yr baseline immediately following ours . \\n moreover , @xcite discovered that the integrated flux of the n lobe varies with a roughly 90-day period . \\n these observations suggest that both n and s lobes vary their fluxes periodically with a phase lag , which is probably a manifestation of the pulsation of the central star modulated by the time - delay due to the line - of - sight path - length difference between the two lobes of the inclined nebula . \\n the linearly - polarized - flux - only images , @xmath19 , were constructed with the stokes _ q _ and _ u _ images ( @xmath20 ; figs . \\n [ figimages]c , d ) . in the single - scattering limit , \\n @xmath19 images represent the cross - sections of the circumstellar shell because @xmath19 tends to be the strongest when the angle of scattering is close to @xmath21 . \\n this uniqueness of @xmath19 had been used previously to probe the dust density structure in the evolve star circumstellar shells @xcite . \\n contrary to our expectations , however , the bipolar lobes and searchlight beams appeared more prominently than the concentric arcs ( figs . \\n [ figimages]c , d ) . \\n this indicates that the nebula can not be approximated in the single - scattering limit ( as evidenced by the presence of the dust lane ) : the is therefore illuminated by a two - step process , in which starlight is first directed into the lobes and then scattered off from the lobes to the rest of the nebula . \\n the polarization strength images , @xmath22 , display the relative strength of polarization more clearly ( figs . \\n [ figimages]e , f ) . while stronger polarizations ( @xmath23 ) are seen in the lobes and searchlight beams , weaker polarizations ( @xmath24 ) \\n are dominant along the equatorial plane except for the region of medium polarizations ( about 30 to @xmath25 , delineating the central @xmath26 region around the dust lane ( @xmath27 by @xmath28 au at 420 pc ) . \\n this medium - polarization region appears to represent the surface of a marginal central dust concentration ( often referred to as a dust cocoon ; @xcite ) at which the line - of - sight optical depth at @xmath29 becomes greater than unity ( i.e. , dustsphere as in photosphere and molsphere ) . \\n this dustsphere and the bipolar lobes are essentially brightly - lit surfaces that illuminate the rest of the nebula . \\n hence , dust - scattered light from the rest of the nebula tends to be de - polarized , i.e. , weak in @xmath19 and @xmath30 . \\n the structure of this central dust concentration is still unknown . \\n @xcite reported the presence of a hollow co shell of @xmath31 radius expanding at @xmath32  km  s@xmath2 at the position angle of @xmath33 ( coincident with the orientation of the 1.3 mm dust continuum ) . \\n thus , this medium - polarization - strength region could represent the `` near - side surface \\'\\' of this central expanding co / dust shell . to better assess the geometry of the central material distribution , further investigations at higher spatial resolution at optically - thin bands are required .      the polarization angle ( _ pa _ \\n @xmath34 ) images show the position angle of the electric vector of the incident light ( figs . \\n [ figimages]g , h ) . \\n images for optically - thin nebulae typically show a pattern of an azimuthal gradient , which represents continuously changing polarization vector angles with respect to the position of the illumination source . \\n however , our maps reveal roughly the same angle near the center generally aligned with the dust lane ( @xmath35 of e of n ) , indicating higher dust density around the dust lane at which the single - scattering approximation breaks down . for this reason \\n , we were unable to pinpoint the location of the illumination source by back - tracing the polarization vectors ( e.g. , @xcite ) more accurately than a one-@xmath13 error ellipse of @xmath36 . \\n as discussed above , the optical reflection nebulosity of the is caused by a two - step illumination process in rather de - polarized light . \\n therefore , we reverted to the total intensity @xmath37 maps ( i.e. , to utilise all the flux available to us ) to follow the differential proper - motion of local shell structures using the same correlational method as in our previous analysis . \\n briefly , this method measures the amount of translational shift of a given structure between two epochs via a cross - correlation analysis between cutouts of the two - epoch images ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \\n we use our own idl script set created as part of our previous proper - motion investigations of the in the near - ir ( @xcite for details ) .    to make the analysis more tractable with the @xmath37 maps , we edge - enhanced the shell structure while minimizing the background noise by processing the maps with the roberts cross operator @xcite . \\n these maps are shown in fig . \\n [ figroberts ] . because concentric arcs are azimuthally symmetric \\n , the present correlational method is unable to break the azimuthal degeneracy and uniquely trace translational shifts of arc segments along the azimuthal direction . \\n this prevented us from following the differential proper - motion of structures azimuthally away from the bipolar axis , and hence , from independently confirming the bulk motion of the nebula and location of the expansion center . \\n thus , for the present analysis we adopted the previously discovered ( 1 ) bulk motion of the at a rate of ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) mas yr@xmath2 , ( 2 ) the location of the illumination source / expansion center , and ( 3 ) the distance to the at @xmath5  pc as found in our previous analysis @xcite . \\n we then selected 30 distinct local structures that register more than five s / n with respect to the sky background distributed in the lobes ( 13 structures ) and searchlight beams radially beyond the lobes ( 17 structures ) and performed the correlational analysis to measure proper motion of these structures . to disregard the inadvertent azimuthal shifts \\n , we extracted only the projected radial component of the expansion of the structures as presented in fig . \\n [ figvectors]a . \\n the same data are displayed as a plot of the projected radial component of the differential proper - motion vector ( @xmath38 in mas  yr@xmath2 and km  s@xmath2 ) vs.  projected radial distance from the location of the illumination source / expansion center ( @xmath39 in arcsec ) in fig . \\n [ figvectors]b . for each of the lobes and arc segments , \\n linear fitting was done to characterize its proper motion . upon fitting , we consider the following three plausible cases : ( 1 ) a linear expansion ( linear fitting of @xmath38 vs.  @xmath39 anchored at the origin ) , ( 2 ) a constant - speed expansion ( fitting by a horizontal line ) , and ( 3 ) a more general linear expansion ( linear fitting with a non - zero intercept ) , and compared their bayesian and akaike information criteria ( bic and aic ) to identify the best - fit . uncertainties in the projected speed and distances are roughly 5.0  mas  yr@xmath2 and 2@xmath40 , respectively . \\n however , the _ relative _ spacing among individual structures within an ensemble remains the same and hence the slope of the linear fitting is robust . \\n the best - fit for the lobes yielded @xmath41  mas  yr@xmath2 or @xmath42  km  s@xmath2 ( the solid white line in the dark - gray zone ) , indicating that the lobes are expanding linearly with the dynamical age of @xmath43  yr , which is roughly consistent with the previous results , @xmath44 and @xmath45  yr ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) . \\n @xcite measured the line of sight velocity of the tips of the co bipolar lobes ( coinciding with the optical lobe tip pair f1/f2 in their figs .  2 and 3 ) as @xmath46  km  s@xmath2 at @xmath47 away from the center . \\n by adopting the projected radial expansion velocity of @xmath48  km  s@xmath2 at the tip of the n lobe , the inclination of the bipolar tips is computed as @xmath49 and the deprojected bipolar outflow velocity as @xmath50  km  s@xmath2 . \\n this outflow velocity is consistent with the medium - velocity component found in co @xcite . \\n the best - fit for the arc segments along the searchlight beams beyond the lobes turned out to be a constant - speed expansion at @xmath51  mas  yr@xmath2 or @xmath52  km  s@xmath2 ( the solid black line in the light - gray zone ) , suggesting that the arcs have been ejected in an on - going basis and coasting away at a constant speed , as opposed to being formed altogether at the same time and expanding linearly . \\n this is a new finding from the present analysis with a larger field of view with respect to the previous analysis by @xcite , in which both growth patterns were found equally likely . \\n a detection of the central co shell of @xmath31 radius expanding at around 10  km  s@xmath2 reported by @xcite , therefore , may be related to the presence of these concentric arcs . \\n if so , the generation of the concentric arcs appears to have been continuing even after the onset of the bipolar lobe expansion .      to further alleviate the azimuthal degeneracy issue of the concentric arcs , we `` unrolled \\'\\' the edge - enhanced @xmath37 maps with respect to the adopted location of the expansion center to make polar ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) maps , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the radial distance from the center and the position angle measured from n , respectively \\n then , we traced the projected radial motion of concentric arcs as a function of the position angle by performing the same correlational analysis only along the radial direction for each @xmath55 azimuthal arc segment as long as these arc segments register more than three-@xmath13 of the background ( fig . \\n [ figunrolled]a , b ) .    fig . \\n [ figunrolled]c shows the distribution of the projected radial velocities of these 1@xmath56 segments measured along 12 most prominent arcs . while uncertainties are relatively large owing to a large s / n discrepancy between the two - epoch maps , the present data suggest that the projected radial velocities tend to ( 1 ) converge to a minimum of about 10  km  s@xmath2 toward the regions of the searchlight beams / bipolar axis , and ( 2 ) increase by a factor of about a few as moving toward the equatorial plane . \\n while the scatterer in the measured radial velocities is large , the increasing tendency appears genuine .    if there were a well - defined azimuthal / latitudinal gradient in the radial expansion velocity field , it should have manifested itself in the overall structure of the concentric arcs \\n the arcs should have been elongated along the equatorial plane at least by a factor of a few \\n . however , the arcs strikingly concentric . \\n therefore , it is most likely that there is a faster outflow ( @xmath57  km  s@xmath2 ) in spatially restricted regions along the equatorial plane and that arc segments along the equatorial plane must have been blown out by such an outflow  the higher - velocity segments near the end of the observed arcs are most likely the arc edges being torn off by the suspected outflow . \\n combined altogether , it appears that there are three distinct outflow components in the circumstellar environs of the . \\n there is a generally spherically symmetric steady outflow with a periodical modulation at about 10  km  s@xmath2 , which is responsible for the concentric arcs . \\n based on the arc segments seen farthest from the center in the higher - s / n epoch 2 map , this periodic outflow appears to have continued at least for the past @xmath3  yr at the interval of @xmath58  yr at 420  pc . \\n this generally symmetric shell structure seems to be disrupted by two distinct outflow components , one along the bipolar axis and the other along the equatorial plane . \\n it has already been shown that the bipolar lobes have been being excavated by a linear expansion for the past @xmath59  yr with the tip velocity being about 30  km  s@xmath2 . \\n circumstantially , this linearly expanding outflow along the polar axis seems to have punched holes out of the central dust cocoon , through which most of the dust - scattered light streams out along the bipolar axis to illuminate the lobes . \\n the present analysis of the concentric arcs has indicated the presence of another outflow component along the equatorial plane : its velocity appears to be greater than @xmath60  km  s@xmath2 based on the ways that concentric arcs are being disrupted along the equatorial plane . \\n other observational details of this outflow including the mode and duration , however , remain unclear . \\n the apparent superposition of three outflow components in the is dynamically very intriguing . \\n while theoretical consideration of the latitudinal dependence of the _ velocity _ field has been rare ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in studying the influence of the central binary system to the agb wind structure , @xcite numerically discovered that ( 1 ) the latitudinal dependence of the gas density is always accompanied by a latitudinal decline in the outflow velocity field , and ( 2 ) there can be a positive correlation between the latitudinal density and velocity contrasts ( i.e. , outflow velocity becomes faster where density is greater ; their model 4 ) , contrary to many dust - driven models that _ assume _ a velocity profile that increases toward the polar direction . \\n this means that the present case may provide rare observational evidence for such a colatitudinally - dependent outflow velocity field resulting from the egg - beater mass - loss modulation by the central binary system . while spiral modulation of mass - loss ejecta due to the central binary system has been seen around agb stars for near pole - on cases ( afgl 3068 ; @xcite , mira ; @xcite , r scl ; @xcite ) , the present data may lend support for an edge - on case in which ( 1 ) the spiraling trails of mass - loss ejecta appear as concentric arcs , and ( 2 ) the colatitudinal velocity field promotes an equatorial outflow fast enough to disrupt the ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    one issue in the present analysis \\n is that the discrepancy in the signal strengths in the two - epoch data set ( due to much lesser s / n of epoch 1 data ) resulted in rather large uncertainties in proper - motion measurements . at any rate , both theoretical and observational work is scarce at best to establish the connection between the concentric arcs and the binary modulation of stellar winds \\n therefore , another epoch of _ hst _ observations to obtain data with a comparable s / n to the epoch 2 data are extremely interesting in quantifying the colatitudinal dependence of the radial velocity field to be compared against the latest theoretical expectations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \\n also , mapping these concentric arcs in co at the comparable spatial resolution of the full _ alma _ is worthwhile ( e.g. , @xcite ) to do understand kinematics between the gas and dust components of these outflows . \\n we performed differential proper - motion and radial - motion analyses on both the signature bipolar lobes and concentric arcs of the using two - epoch optical data taken by the _ hst_. \\n our method , based on ( 1 ) aligning two - epoch images using stationary background stars as spatial anchors , and ( 2 ) measuring the amount translational movement of specific local structures by a correlational method , is more robust than the previous analysis by @xcite that assumed symmetry in the shell expansion . \\n our findings are that ;    1 . \\n the is illuminated optically by a two - step mechanism , in which the direct starlight is first channeled into the bipolar cavities and then scattered off to the rest of the nebula , 2 . \\n there is a `` dustsphere \\'\\' around the central star ( @xmath27  au by @xmath28 au at 420  pc ) , most likely representing the surface of the central dust concentration at which the line - of - sight optical depth in the @xmath29 band becomes significantly larger than unity , 3 . \\n the bipolar lobes expand linearly for the past @xmath43  yr , excavating into an otherwise symmetric concentric shells as found by the previous analyses @xcite , 4 . \\n arc segments found along the searchlight beams beyond the bipolar lobes all move at similar projected radial velocity at @xmath52  km  s@xmath2 for the past @xmath3  yr , 5 . \\n the projected radial expansion velocity field of the concentric arcs shows an increasing trending toward the equatorial plane by a factor of a few , representing torn - off edges of the arcs disrupted by a fast equatorial outflow at @xmath61  km  s@xmath2 , and 6 \\n .   the present case may provide observational evidence for the binary modulation of stellar winds , as predicted by @xcite , which generates the colatitudinal dependence in the radial expansion velocity field and the spiral - shocks of the mass - loss ejecta appearing concentric arcs in near edge - on orientations . \\n support for this work was provided by nasa / stsci through a grant hst - ar-12157.01-a and by the university of denver through a professional research opportunities for faculty ( prof ) grant . \\n authors thank dr . \\n d.  a.  weintraub for explaining his method to pinpoint the location of the illumination source in the imaging polarimetry data thoroughly to us . \\n authors also acknowledge drs . \\n robert e.  stencel and djazia ladjal for their excellent comments which improved the work . \\n maercker , m. , mohamed , s. , vlemmings , w.  h.  t. , ramstedt , s. , groenewegen , m.  a.  t. , humphreys , e. , kerschbaum , f. , lindqvist , m. , olofsson , h. , paladini , c. , wittkowski , m. , de gregorio -

       "  'abstract': \"we present the results of differential proper - motion analyses of the egg nebula ( rafgl 2688 , v1610 cyg ) based on the archived two - epoch optical data taken with the hubble space telescope . \\n first , we determined that the polarization characteristics of the is influenced by the higher optical depth of the central regions of the nebula ( i.e. , the `` dustsphere '' of @xmath0 au radius ) , causing the nebula illuminated in two steps  the direct starlight is first channeled into bipolar cavities and then scattered off to the rest of the nebula . \\n we then measured the amount of motion of local structures and the signature concentric arcs by determining their relative shifts over the 7.25-yr interval . based on our analysis , which does not rely on the single - scattering assumption \\n , we concluded that the lobes have been excavated by a linear expansion along the bipolar axis for the past @xmath1  yr , while the concentric arcs have been generated continuously and moving out radially at about 10  km  s@xmath2 for the past @xmath3  yr , and there appears to be a colatitudinally - increasing trend in the radial expansion velocity field of the concentric arcs . \\n there exist numerical investigations into the mass - loss modulation by the central binary system , which predict such a colatitudinally - increasing expansion velocity field in the spiral - shock trails of the mass - loss ejecta . \\n therefore , the egg nebula may represent a rare edge - on case of the binary - modulated circumstellar environs , corroborating the previous theoretical predictions .\"}]"

      " that the opo cavity may be considered as a system with both ... linear systems theory: so we are able to decompose it in such a way that our matrix A = [[ g, b d b], [eta * b^2 - ... ] , etc. Then we can model our system as a linear quadrature system... I think the key issue here is whether using linear algebraic methods ( matrix decomposition) can effectively capture both the linear and nonlinear aspects of the cavity dynamics to achieve the desired homodyne feedback for squeezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize that this is similar to the quadrature models used in quantum optics, which model both classical and quantum signals but are designed with nonlinear effects minimized or not explicitly considered. So, in our case, we can't just rely on linear methods because of nonlinear effects like amplified frequencies or frequency shifts ... but using linear algebra isn't suited for capturing nonlinear dynamics without explicit consideration. Hence, when we use these matrix-based techniques to model the system as a linear quadrature system, it doesn't capture the nonlinearities effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize that this is also an issue with my methodology: I don't have the knowledge of how to handle nonlinearities in linear systems theory ... only for the simple case where the feedback is linear and additive (like dc damping), it's straightforward. However, when we're dealing with the nonlinearities introduced by the optical components like mirrors and resonators, their frequencies can shift or amplify signals ... so modeling them as a linear system isn't possible unless we have a way to account for those nonlinear effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, when I look at the feedback loops in our opo network, both plant and controller parameters are causing nonlinear behavior that cannot be handled by simple linear methods. So using matrix-based techniques is inadequate for capturing these nonlinearities, leading to incomplete model of the system dynamics, which prevents us from predicting squeezing accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the conclusion here is that linear algebra isn't sufficient to handle the nonlinear aspects of the opo network when considering both the plant and controller parameters as having linear contributions. Instead, we need a different approach, possibly one inspired by the quadrature models used in quantum optics or other areas where nonlinear effects are managed differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps using the matrix-based techniques for linear systems isn't going to work here because it doesn't account for the nonlinearities introduced by optical components like mirrors and resonators. Therefore, our analysis needs to focus on how to handle these nonlinear aspects without being limited by traditional linear system theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a crucial point because if we rely solely on linear methods, they can't capture both the plant and controller parameters' contributions in their nonlinear ways. So maybe instead of using linear algebra techniques, we should think differently or look for alternative methods that can handle nonlinearities without being bound to linear systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps it's better to use something like the state-dependent model with feedback matrices, but I don't know how exactly to do this with matrix-based models unless we have a way to account for those nonlinear effects without them becoming additive terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe using frequency-domain analysis or considering time-varying systems differently could help. But if I stick to linear algebraic methods like in our initial approach, it's not going to work because the nonlinearities aren't accounted for.\n",

      "So perhaps we need a different approach altogether, one that can handle both plant and controller parameters' contributions without being limited by simple linear system theory.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, based on the analysis above, the conclusion is that matrix-based techniques are insufficient due to their reliance on linear systems theory. Nonlinear effects caused by optical components like mirrors and resonators cannot be modeled effectively with these methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, instead of relying solely on linear algebraic methods, a different approach inspired by quadrature models used in quantum optics or other nonlinear system handling should be considered for analyzing the nonlinearities introduced by these components.\n",
      "\n",
      "This change would allow us to better handle the nonlinear dynamics, leading to an accurate modeling of squeezing behavior and its implications.\n",

      "The linear algebraic methods are insufficient due to their reliance on linear systems theory. Nonlinear effects caused by optical components cannot be effectively modeled with simple linear matrix-based techniques, making it inadequate for capturing both plant and controller parameters' contributions in nonlinear ways.

      " these objects are cubical objects with extra degeneracies , called connections . \n",
      " to stress importance and naturality of cubical objects with connections it suffices to name e.  g. the following three facts . \n",
      " the singular cubical complex of any topological space has naturally defined connections . \n",
      " next , tonks in [ 19 ] has shown that any cubical group with connections satisfies the kan condition . \n",

      " projective precubical resolutions which we are using to construct cubical derived functors possess pseudodegeneracies and pseudoconnections and this fact is essentially used in the construction of derived functors defined by us . \n",

      " the well known moore theorem says that if @xmath6 is a simplicial object in @xmath1 , then this inclusion is a chain homotopy equivalence ( in fact this is valid for any pseudosimplicial object in @xmath1 ) . on the other hand , for any precubical object @xmath9 in an abelian category @xmath1 , one has the canonical inclusion @xmath10 of chain complexes @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath1 which are cubical analogs of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see [ 16 , 17 ] ) respectively , and which functorially depend on @xmath9 . in section 2 \n",

    " let us say few words about cubical objects and techniques . \n",
    " as it is well known , simplicial methods are developed for long time and are successfully used in algebra and topology . with less success , but still also cubical techniques have been developed , which was initiated on one hand by the systematic use of singular cubes in the singular homology theory of topological spaces ( see , for example , [ 14 ] ) , and , on the other hand , by the papers of kan [ 12 , 13 ] which have related cubical sets to homotopy theory . \n",
    " further research ( see e.  g. [ 1,2,4,5,8 - 11,16,17,19 ] ) has also shown that the cubical approach is interesting and important . \n",
    " cubical objects have a number of advantages compared to the simplicial ones . \n",
    " for example , a ( pre)cubical homotopy is given by a single morphism in each dimension , whereas a ( pre)simplicial homotopy requires `` many '' morphisms . on the other hand , \n",
    " significant disadvantages of the cubical technique with respect to the simplicial one are also apparent . \n",
    " for example , a cubical group , in fact even a cubical abelian group , can fail to satisfy the kan condition [ 16,17 ] . in the context of elimination of these and other disadvantages of the cubical theory , of extreme importance \n",
    " are cubical objects with connections introduced by brown and higgins [ 4 ] . \n",
    " these objects are cubical objects with extra degeneracies , called connections . \n",
    " to stress importance and naturality of cubical objects with connections it suffices to name e.  g. the following three facts . \n",
    " the singular cubical complex of any topological space has naturally defined connections . \n",
    " next , tonks in [ 19 ] has shown that any cubical group with connections satisfies the kan condition . \n",
    " finally , brown and higgins [ 5 ] have recently proved that the category of cubical objects with connections in an abelian category is equivalent to the category of nonnegative chain complexes in the same category .    in this paper \n",
    " we introduce pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections , obtained from the brown - higgins structure of a cubical object with connections by suitably relaxing their identities . \n",
    " projective precubical resolutions which we are using to construct cubical derived functors possess pseudodegeneracies and pseudoconnections and this fact is essentially used in the construction of derived functors defined by us . \n",
    " now let us list the contents of the paper by sections . \n",
    " in section [ prelim ] we recall the notions of presimplicial , pseudosimplicial and simplicial objects , precubical , cubical objects and cubical objects with connections , their morphisms , and the respective augmented versions of these notions . \n",
    " we also recall the definitions of normalization functors in the simplicial setting by moore , and in the cubical setting by wiatek [ 16 ] . \n",
    " furthermore we recall the kan cubical sets and their homotopy groups .    for any presimplicial object @xmath6 in an abelian category @xmath1 the normalized chain complex of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath7 in this paper , is a chain subcomplex of the unnormalized chain complex of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath8 . \n",
    " the well known moore theorem says that if @xmath6 is a simplicial object in @xmath1 , then this inclusion is a chain homotopy equivalence ( in fact this is valid for any pseudosimplicial object in @xmath1 ) . on the other hand , for any precubical object @xmath9 in an abelian category @xmath1 , one has the canonical inclusion @xmath10 of chain complexes @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath1 which are cubical analogs of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see [ 16 , 17 ] ) respectively , and which functorially depend on @xmath9 . in section 2 \n",
    " we introduce pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections and prove that @xmath13 is a chain homotopy equivalence for any pseudocubical object @xmath9 with pseudoconnections ( in particular for any cubical object @xmath9 with connections ) . \n",

    " then we establish some results which are not needed later on ; however they seem interesting by themselves . \n",
    " let us mention some of them . \n",
    " we indicate an alternative proof of the aforementioned brown - higgins equivalence . furthermore , we point out that this equivalence is realized by the above functor @xmath14 . \n",
    " next , we show that if @xmath15 is a kan cubical group , then @xmath16 , the @xmath17-th homotopy group of @xmath15 , coincides with @xmath18 , the @xmath17-th homology group of @xmath19 ( note that @xmath19 and @xmath18 are defined for any cubical group @xmath15 as well ) . using this and the cubical analog of the moore theorem together with the aforementioned result of tonks \n",

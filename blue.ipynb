( 1998 ) on march 13 , 1996 through the @xmath40 filter . \\n the total exposure time was 15600s . \\n following the usual reduction process the images were deconvolved with the clean algorithm ( hgbom 1974 ) , using tiny tim ( krist 1995 ) psfs appropriate for the positions of the galaxies on the wfpc2 chips . \\n the six galaxies with early - type spectra appear to be unperturbed e and s0 galaxies ( fig . \\n [ galaxies.plot ] ) . \\n the two e+a galaxies have more peculiar morphologies . \\n galaxy 1430 has a disk with faint spiral structure , and is lopsided . \\n galaxy 1583 also has a disk , and a very luminous , compact bulge . \\n it may be interacting with the small companion galaxy to the south . \\n we determined effective radii and effective surface brightnesses of the galaxies using the 2d fitting method outlined in vdf . \\n the values of @xmath41 ( in arcseconds ) and @xmath42 are listed in table 1 . as noted by many authors ( e.g. , jfk ) , the errors in @xmath41 and @xmath43 are correlated , and the correlation is almost parallel to the fundamental plane . \\n therefore , the product @xmath44 , which enters the fp , can be determined to high accuracy . \\n table 1 + galaxy parameters +    [ cols=\"^,^,>,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ] \\n the edge - on projection of the fundamental plane in 054 is shown in fig . \\n [ fp.plot ] . \\n the surface brightnesses ( @xmath45 ) have been corrected for the @xmath46 cosmological dimming . \\n the effective radii were converted using @xmath47 and @xmath48mpc@xmath49 . \\n the open symbols are the two e+a galaxies . \\n the small dots are galaxies in coma at @xmath50 , taken from jfk . \\n the line is the fit from jfk . \\n the six galaxies with early - type spectra define a clear fp , with low scatter ( @xmath51 in @xmath52 ) . \\n the slope is similar to that of the coma cluster . \\n a larger sample is needed to determine the scatter and the slope reliably . \\n the offset of the fp of 054 with respect to the fp of coma is due to the evolution of the @xmath1 ratio between @xmath0 and the present . \\n the e+a galaxies are over - luminous with respect to the prediction from the fp defined by the other galaxies in 054 , consistent with the presence of a young population . \\n the e+as have lower masses than the other galaxies in the sample . in the following analysis \\n , we will only consider the galaxies with early - type spectra . \\n therefore , our conclusions may only apply to a subset of the galaxy population . \\n we will return to this point in sect . \\n [ disc.sec ] . \\n we determined the evolution of the @xmath1 ratio from the fp . in fig.[ml.plot ] , the evolution of the @xmath1 ratio from @xmath53 to @xmath0 is plotted . \\n included in the figure are data for coma at @xmath53 from jfk , for cl0024 + 16 at @xmath54 from vdf , and for cl1358 + 62 at @xmath55 and ms2053 + 03 at @xmath56 from kvdfif . \\n all data were transformed to a common rest frame band , equivalent to the @xmath40 band in the observed frame at @xmath0 . \\n this band is very close to the @xmath18 band redshifted to @xmath0 , and is denoted @xmath57 . for 054 at @xmath0 , @xmath58 . \\n the transformations for the other clusters were derived in a similar way as is described in vdf . \\n for all clusters , the observed bands are close to the redshifted @xmath18 band , and the color terms in the transformations are small . \\n since the observed colors of the galaxies are used in the transformations , the procedure is very different from a @xmath59-correction , and is independent of the spectral types of the galaxies . using spectral energy distributions from pence ( 1976 ) , we estimate the error induced by the transformations is @xmath60 magnitudes for all spectral types . because the scatter in the fp is very small , the errorbars in fig . \\n 3 are mainly due to systematic errors . \\n we have assumed that the systematic errors in the dispersions , in the photometric zeropoints , and the errors caused by the sample selection ( see vdf ) can be added in quadrature . \\n the @xmath1 ratio evolves as @xmath61 if @xmath3 , or @xmath62 if @xmath13 . \\n this is consistent with other measurements of the luminosity evolution of early - type galaxies to @xmath63 ( e.g. , schade et al .  1997 ) . \\n however , our measurement has a much smaller uncertainty , due to the low scatter in the fp . \\n the observed evolution of the @xmath1 ratio with redshift can be compared to predictions for the evolution of single age stellar populations formed at redshift @xmath11 . \\n the luminosity evolution of a single age stellar population behaves as a power law : @xmath64 . \\n the evolution depends on @xmath65 , the cosmology , and @xmath11 ( vdf ) . \\n the value of @xmath65 depends on the passband , the imf , and the metallicity . \\n the models of bruzual & charlot ( 1998 ) , vazdekis et al . \\n ( 1996 ) and worthey ( 1998 ) give @xmath66 for a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath67 } < 0.5 $ ] . \\n model predictions are shown in fig . \\n [ ml.plot](a ) for @xmath68 ( open area ) and @xmath69 ( shaded area ) , for a universe with @xmath70 and no cosmological constant ( @xmath71 ) . \\n note that the models as well as the data points in fig . \\n [ ml.plot ] are independent of the value of @xmath72 . \\n the formal 95% confidence lower limit on the formation redshift is @xmath73 , for solar metallicity , a salpeter imf and @xmath71 .    the slow evolution of massive galaxies in clusters not only provides a constraint on their formation redshift , but also on cosmological models ( e.g. , bender et al . \\n this is illustrated in fig . \\n [ ml.plot](b ) , which shows the same models as in fig . \\n [ ml.plot](a ) for @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) rather than @xmath3 . \\n the models fail to fit the data in this cosmology , and we find @xmath76 ( @xmath77% confidence ) . \\n the constraint on @xmath78 is considerably stronger than the constraint derived by bender et al.(1998 ) from the combination of the mg@xmath79 \\n @xmath80 relation and the fundamental plane at @xmath81 , due to the higher redshift of 054 . \\n these results are based on the assumption that massive early - type galaxies in clusters have a salpeter imf . \\n there is considerable uncertainty in the slope and form of the imf in the mass range around @xmath82 ( scalo 1997 ) , and there are only indirect constraints on the imf of massive ellipticals in clusters ( e.g. , gibson & matteucci 1997 ) . \\n the value of @xmath65 , and hence the rate of evolution , is quite sensitive to the logarithmic slope of the imf : the worthey ( 1998 ) models give @xmath83 . \\n since the imf is very uncertain , we express our results as a combined constraint on @xmath78 and the slope of the imf in fig.[imfomega.plot ] . \\n the imf is steep if @xmath74 . \\n the 95% confidence lower limit on the slope is @xmath14 for @xmath13 . as an illustration , the broken line in fig.[ml.plot](b ) indicates a model with @xmath13 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . \\n this model fits the data very well . \\n the case @xmath69 is extreme ; the dependence on the formation redshift of the constraints on @xmath78 and @xmath86 is indicated with an arrow in fig . \\n [ imfomega.plot ] . for lower formation redshifts ( or higher metallicities ) \\n the constraints are stronger . as an example , for @xmath87 rather than @xmath88 we find that @xmath89 for @xmath5 , and @xmath90 for @xmath13 . \\n we note that if @xmath8 , as is indicated by distant supernovae ( riess et al . \\n 1998 ) , the constraints on @xmath11 and the slope of the imf are much weaker . figure [ ml.plot](c ) shows the evolution of the @xmath1 ratio if @xmath3 and @xmath10 \\n . the lower limit on the formation redshift is @xmath91 . in this cosmology , \\n the data provide no meaningful constraint on the slope of the imf .    the implicit assumption in this type of study that the set of high redshift early - types is similar to the set of low redshift early - types ( e.g. , kauffmann 1995 , van dokkum & franx 1996 ) is probably justified for the high mass galaxies considered here . \\n it seems unlikely that a significant fraction of the high mass galaxies in clusters at @xmath92 was added to the sample between @xmath0 and @xmath92 , given the tightness of the color - magnitude relation of luminous galaxies in intermediate @xmath93 clusters ( e.g. , ellis et al . \\n 1997 , van dokkum et al . \\n 1998 ) , and the low masses of the e+a galaxies ( franx 1993b , kvdfif ) . \\n however , our conclusions may not hold for low mass galaxies : there is good evidence that a significant fraction of the low luminosity early - type galaxies at @xmath92 was accreted from the field at @xmath94 ( e.g. , abraham et al . \\n 1996 , van dokkum et al . \\n the two e+a galaxies in our sample may be galaxies that were recently accreted . \\n larger samples to fainter magnitudes are needed to assess the fraction of galaxies with young populations in @xmath95 clusters , and their masses .    in conclusion , the luminosity evolution of massive early - type galaxies to @xmath96 \\n has now been determined to sufficient accuracy to place strong constraints on the epoch of formation of the galaxies , and on cosmological models . \\n the main uncertainty in the interpretation is the poor understanding of the imf in the mass range around one solar mass . \\n other applications of the fp suffer from the same uncertainty ( e.g. , bender et al . \\n nevertheless , our current measurement can be used directly to correct the evolution of the luminosity function for the brightening of the stellar populations with redshift . \\n this can provide direct constraints on the mass evolution of galaxies . \\n abraham , r. g. , smecker -

generator correctly annihilates diffeomorphism invariant states . in this paper \\n we will introduce a hamiltonian constraint based on the loop derivative . \\n we will limit the discussion to invariants of trivalent vertices and will only concentrate on the `` euclidean '' part of the hamiltonian constraint in the sense of barbero @xcite and thiemann @xcite . limiting ourselves to trivalent intersections \\n is clearly unphysical since the volume operator identically vanishes on such states . however , the essence of most calculations is already present with trivalent intersections and the calculational difficulty is significantly lower than with four or higher valent intersections . \\n we will come back to this issue in the discussion section where we will highlight which results are quite plausibly going to survive when one goes to higher valent intersections . \\n we will then extend the space of invariants through the construction of `` habitats '' such that the resulting states are not diffeomorphism invariant . based on these states \\n we will check the consistency of the quantum commutator algebra of diffeomorphisms and hamiltonian . \\n we will show that there are no anomalies , therefore constituting a consistent theory of canonical quantum gravity . \\n we will start in the next section by introducing the hamiltonian constraint of quantum gravity in terms of the loop derivative . \\n this derivation will be `` generic '' in the sense that we will motivate it through formal manipulations of the loop transform and therefore will not make specific assumptions about the quantum state in the connection representation on which the operator is acting upon . without being more precise about the space of states upon which it acts , we can not guarantee that the operator is well defined . \\n we will show that on several spaces related to the vassiliev invariants the operator is indeed well defined . \\n the results obtained will be later applied in specific `` habitats '' in which we will show that the operators exist and we can compute correctly the commutators . \\n this we will discuss in section iii . \\n the need to introduce new ( non - diffeomorphism - invariant ) `` habitats '' is based on the fact that the spaces we have considered in the companion paper are all diffeomorphism invariant and therefore one can not explore in a non - trivial way commutators involving the diffeomorphisms . \\n we will introduce an explicit example of such a habitat in detail , the `` functions with marked vertices '' . in the end \\n we will see that we will be able to recover the classical poisson algebra at the level of quantum commutators , but there will be subtle issues involved in the definition of the right hand side of the commutator of two hamiltonians , which we will discuss in detail . \\n the last section will be devoted to discussing the implications of the level of consistency achieved by the theory . \\n we wish to introduce a quantum version of the hamiltonian constraint of canonical general relativity . \\n following thiemann @xcite , one can construct this operator introducing the real version of the ashtekar variables first discussed by barbero @xcite . in this formulation , \\n the canonical pair consists of a set of ( densitized ) triads @xmath0 and as conjugate variables real - valued @xmath1 connections @xmath2 . \\n the hamiltonian constraint of canonical , real , lorentzian general relativity in this framework consists of two terms , @xmath3 where @xmath4    in these expressions , @xmath5 is the newton constant and in ( [ k ] ) @xmath6 means that the smearing function @xmath7 is unity . \\n this remarkable formulation implies that the hamiltonian constraint is composed by two terms . the first one , @xmath8 , coincides with the hamiltonian constraint one would obtain in a canonical formulation of general relativity on a manifold of euclidean signature . \\n the lorentzian theory is therefore attained through the addition of an extra term . \\n both terms are given as expressions involving the poisson bracket of a connection with the volume of the space @xmath9 and with the function @xmath10 . \\n the latter can be in turn obtained as a poisson bracket of the euclidean part of the hamiltonian constraint with the volume . \\n in this paper we will only concentrate on realizing at a quantum mechanical level the euclidean part of the hamiltonian . \\n if the reader wishes , we are considering canonical quantum gravity in the euclidean context . \\n however , it should be noticed that the additional term in the hamiltonian is obtained by successive commutators of the operator we will consider , with the volume operator . \\n this suggests that one could generalize our construction to the lorentzian case rather straightforwardly , but this has not been studied in detail . \\n the work of thiemann also shows that similar structures arise if one couples the theory to matter . \\n we will in this paper only concentrate on the vacuum case but again one does not see a priori impediments to extend our treatment to general relativity coupled to matter .    to implement the hamiltonian constraint we will partially use the same procedure proposed by thiemann . \\n we will not describe it again in full detail here , we just list some of the salient features . \\n one starts by writing the classical expression ( [ hame ] ) as @xmath11 f_\\\\epsilon(y , x)\\\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a regularization of the dirac delta function , i.e. @xmath13 . strictly speaking \\n , this expression is only gauge invariant in the limit , so to preserve gauge invariance in the regularization procedure we will `` join '' the @xmath14 with the connection using an infinitesimal piece of holonomy @xmath15 along an arbitrary path @xmath16 going from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , which tends to the null path in the limit @xmath19 . to unclutter the notation we will therefore denote @xmath20 , @xmath21 f_\\\\epsilon(y , x ) \\\\label{uno}\\\\ ] ]    in order to prepare the classical expression for quantization , we triangulate the space - like hypersurface @xmath22 in terms of elementary tetrahedra @xmath23 . the triangulation has the following properties : we select a finite set of distinct points of @xmath22 , denoted as @xmath24 . at each of these points \\n we choose three independent directions @xmath25 and construct the eight tetrahedra with vertex @xmath26 and edges @xmath27 , with @xmath28 . \\n the eight tetrahedra saturating @xmath26 define a closed region @xmath29 of length scale @xmath30 . \\n the remaining region @xmath31 is triangulated by arbitrary tetrahedra @xmath32 . \\n the motivation for this peculiar discretization is that when we promote the classical expression to a quantum operator , we will adapt the triangulation to the spin network of the state in question by choosing the points @xmath26 to coincide with the vertices of the spin network . in terms of this triangulation of space \\n we can write equation ( [ uno ] ) in the form , @xmath33 f_\\\\diamond(y)\\\\,,\\\\label{hamt}\\\\ ] ] where the regions @xmath34 indicate either a box @xmath29 or a tetrahedron @xmath32 , and @xmath35 is any point interior to @xmath34 . \\n conventionally we will choose for the boxes @xmath36 , and for the tetrahedra @xmath37 will represent one of its vertices . to discretize the integral \\n we have introduced the volume of each region @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 if @xmath41 , and @xmath42 if @xmath43 . in this last case , \\n the @xmath44 s represent the edges of the tetrahedra @xmath32 adjacent to @xmath37 . \\n we also have adapted the regularization of the dirac delta function to the tetrahedral decomposition by defining , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is one if @xmath47 and zero otherwise . \\n we now replace in ( [ hamt ] ) the @xmath48 using formula ( [ vol ] ) and we represent @xmath49 using a holonomy in the fundamental representation along the edge @xmath50 of the triangulation , @xmath51f_\\\\diamond(y)\\\\ , , \\\\label{classham}\\\\ ] ] and we retraced the path described by the holonomy to preserve gauge invariance . \\n it should be noticed that this retracing does not contribute to the expression at leading order in @xmath30 ( the scale parameter of the regions @xmath34 ) . \\n we will now proceed to study the quantization of the last expression . for \\n that we need to `` adapt '' the triangulation we introduced to a spin network state @xmath52 @xcite . \\n let @xmath53 be the set of vertices of the spin network and let @xmath54 be the triples of non - coplanar edges incident at @xmath55 ( @xmath56 , being @xmath57 the number of such triples ) . \\n to adapt the triangulation to the spin network state we perform two operations : first we identify the points @xmath26 of the boxes @xmath29 with the vertices @xmath55 and second , given a triple of edges @xmath54 incident at @xmath55 , we orientate the three unit vectors @xmath58 along the tangents of the edges at @xmath55 . \\n then we can write , @xmath59 to simplify the notation we identify from now on @xmath60 . as in the previous paper , we assume we are acting on a state given by a loop transform , @xmath61 w_a[s]\\\\ , , \\\\label{states}\\\\ ] ] and we realize the hamiltonian operator over the spin network wavefunctions by promoting the classical expression ( [ classham ] ) as an operator acting on the wilson net appearing in the loop transform , very much as we did in the companion paper when we discussed the diffeomorphism operator , @xmath62 \\\\right)f_{\\\\box_v}(y ) w_a(s)\\\\,.\\\\nonumber\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] a first observation is that the volume operator has non - vanishing contributions only at the vertices of the spin net , so we replace the sum in the hamiltonian over all @xmath34 s by a sum over all the vertices of the spin net . \\n the second observation is that , for an n - valent vertex , we have taken the average over all the non - coplanar triples of edges associated with this vertex . \\n finally notice that only one of the terms in the commutator contributes , that with the volume operator on the left . \\n the one with the volume operator on the right vanishes since it is proportional to the trace of the lie algebra element @xmath63 . \\n let us now consider a generic @xmath64valent vertex and study the action of the operator on the wilson net . \\n we assume that the holonomies are all outgoing from @xmath26 . \\n schematically , we are trying to represent the action of @xmath65 , with @xmath66 a generic edge of spin @xmath67 incident at @xmath26 . \\n an @xmath64valent vertex is characterized by an intertwiner that can be represented through a vector @xmath68 of @xmath69 of irreducible representations . \\n the factor @xmath70 acts by adding a line of spin @xmath71 ingoing from the vertex @xmath26 and parallel to the line @xmath66 , @xmath72 notice that the insertion of the holonomy leaves a wilson net that is not gauge invariant anymore , we represent this by keeping the group indices @xmath73 in the diagram . \\n if one was acting on an @xmath64valent vertex characterized by an intertwiner @xmath68 , this leaves an @xmath74valent vertex characterized by intertwiners @xmath75 ; @xmath67 being in the diagram the spin of the line connecting the original vertex to the point ( infinitesimally nearby ) where the holonomy was inserted . notice that @xmath67 coincides with the spin of the original line @xmath66 . \\n we denote that the line is infinitesimally close by the dashed circle . \\n we now act with the volume operator . for that we first have to reduce the product of holonomies associated with @xmath66 to a superposition of irreducible representations . \\n this procedure defines a new intertwiner for the vertex @xmath26 over which the action of the volume operator is well - defined , @xmath76 the action of the volume operator can be represented by a matrix that rearranges the intertwining of the vertex . \\n this matrix elements would depend also on the spins of the external edges of the vertex ( notice that @xmath10 is the color of one of this external edges ) . \\n schematically , @xmath77 where in the last step we reduce the line of spin @xmath71 of the holonomy using recoupling theory . \\n one is left with a double insertion at the vertex , which we can rearrange via recoupling , since everything is happening infinitesimally close to the vertex . \\n we write the result in the following way , @xmath78 the above expression has now to be contracted with @xmath14 at the open strands labeled with @xmath79 and @xmath80 . \\n one can generate @xmath14 by introducing an extension of the idea of loop derivative for spin networks . \\n the reason why one does not simply recover the ordinary loop derivative is that the edge before and after the point of the insertion of @xmath14 are in general in different representations @xmath67 and @xmath81 . \\n the ordinary loop derivative inserts an @xmath14 without changing the representation of the original line . \\n this definition of loop derivative appeared as natural in the context of loops , however in terms of spin networks one expects in general to have a situation like the one we have here . \\n one can use the same set of constructions we did for the ordinary loop derivative of the invariant @xmath82 to compute the action of this generalized loop derivative is proportional to the inverse of the coupling constant of chern - simons theory . for \\n a definition of the invariant @xmath82 , see the companion paper , section ii.c . ] . \\n however , we will not pursue the exploration of this generalized derivative in this paper . \\n instead we will concentrate on the case of trivalent intersections . \\n if the spin networks considered have trivalent intersections , when we repeat the construction we did above , the representations of the edges before and after the insertion of @xmath14 are the same . \\n the operator we then obtain to represent @xmath14 corresponds in this case to the ordinary loop derivative . \\n we have now to consider the action of the volume operator over a four - valent vertex with only three real edges @xcite , @xmath83 with @xmath84 where @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . using this result , the matrix elements of equation ( [ nval ] ) \\n are reduced to the following simple expression for trivalent vertices ( @xmath87 in this case ) , @xmath88 where @xmath89 , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the other spins of the edges incident at the trivalent vertex . \\n therefore the spin of the link going from the intersection to the point of insertion of @xmath14 is unchanged through the action of the volume operator . by inserting the @xmath14 \\n we obtain the final action of the hamiltonian constraint on trivalent vertices ,    @xmath92    the superscript on the loop derivative denotes at which of the incident edges at the intersection it adds the extra strand @xmath16 . \\n notice that since @xmath93 is summed by the einstein convention , the derivative ends up acting on all edges ( we have abused of the summation convention allowing the index @xmath93 to be repeated three times in the last expression ) . \\n the vector @xmath94 labels the spins of the tree edges of the spin network incident at @xmath26 ( @xmath95 is the spin of the edge @xmath96 ) , and the group factor @xmath97 is given by the expression , @xmath98 where the indices @xmath99 take cyclic values in the set @xmath100 . \\n we have therefore a general expression for the hamiltonian constraint acting on any loop - differentiable wavefunction with support on trivalent spin networks , that bears a relationship with a wavefunction in the connection representation @xmath101 given by ( [ states ] ) .    at this point \\n it is worthwhile comparing this action of the hamiltonian constraint we just introduced with the original proposal of a hamiltonian constraint in the loop representation ( doubly densitized ) in terms of loop derivative as introduced in @xcite . \\n such constraint was written in @xcite as , @xmath102 the hamiltonian acted on functions of loops and the operator @xmath103 had the action of re - routing one of the lobes of the partition of the loop determined by the points @xmath104 . \\n we see two fundamental differences with the operator we just introduced . \\n the first one is the re - routing operator @xmath103 . \\n this operator arose in the loop representation to account for the fact that states based on loops in the fundamental representation do not diagonalize operators like the volume . in the spin network context \\n the operator is replaced by the group factors we discussed . \\n more important is the difference concerning density weights . in the hamiltonian in terms of loops \\n we see that one obtains a doubly densitized quantity by considering the product of a dirac delta times the regulator . \\n to understand properly this difference , it is worthwhile considering on which spaces of functions are these operators meant to operate upon . in the hamiltonian in terms of loops one \\n had in mind that the loop derivative was acting on functions of loops such that the result was a smooth function . \\n an example of such functions would be holonomies built with a smooth connection . \\n the resulting expression would then consist of a smooth tensor , @xmath14 , a dirac delta integrated on three dimensional space and , in the limit , a two dimensional dirac delta given by @xmath105 integrated along the two one dimensional integrals . \\n the result is finite but is regularization dependent , since the two dimensional dirac delta has an inverse power of the three dimensional volume in it that is not compensated . \\n if we now turn our attention to the hamiltonian we introduced in this paper , and consider its action on a state of the form @xmath82 , we will see a different behavior . given the action ( companion paper : formulas 71 and 44 ) of the loop derivative on @xmath82 we get , @xmath106 where the extra edge added by the loop derivative starts and ends in the edge @xmath107 and as before , @xmath99 take cyclic values in the set @xmath100 . \\n the reason for this is that if it ended in any other edge incident on the vertex one would ( in the limit @xmath108 ) get zero for the action since one would have an integral repeated over one of the edges contracted with @xmath109 . \\n the action on @xmath110 of the loop derivative that appears in the hamiltonian constraint , for trivalent vertices reduces therefore to a chord diagram . if we evaluate the chord diagram using recoupling identities , we finally get , @xmath111 at this point it is worthwhile continuing the comparison with the doubly densitized case . \\n if we evaluate the integrals involved in the above expression we see that we have six one dimensional integrals and two three dimensional dirac delta functions . in the limit \\n we therefore have a finite result , that is defined independent of the background structures introduced by the regulator @xmath112 . \\n one first performs the integral in @xmath18 , which fixes @xmath113 and then one is left with three one dimensional integrals with three step functions ( two explicit , one present in the @xmath114 ) . \\n the result of the integrals is @xmath115 , which cancels the denominator of the @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) and one is left with a finite result , that in the limit @xmath108 gives , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the factor group associated with the vertex @xmath26 . \\n we have introduced a quantum version of thiemann s singly - densitized classical hamiltonian in terms of the loop derivative that has the remarkable following properties :    \\\\a ) it has a significant resemblance to the original doubly - densitized hamiltonian proposed in the loop representation @xcite , which in turn closed the constraint algebra formally @xcite . \\n we will discuss the implications of this in the next section . \\n \\\\b ) the hamiltonian introduced is finite on the space of vassiliev invariants we introduced in the previous paper . \\n this happens due to the detailed form in which the loop derivative acts on these states . \\n \\\\c ) the hamiltonian may be well defined on other spaces of states . \\n for instance , on the space of functions of spin nets obtained by considering the wilson nets along smooth holonomies ( the original kind of function that was first considered as loop differentiable ) , it is straightforward that the hamiltonian identically vanishes ( essentially , since the loop derivative is smooth , the integrals that before gained contributions due to the distributional character of the loop derivative now vanish ) . \\n \\\\d ) the last two points show that something surprising is happening here , in the sense that _ we did not construct the hamiltonian in an ad - hoc way to obtain properties b ) and c)_. that is , we introduced a discretization of the singly - densitized hamiltonian and it naturally turned out to be well defined on the vassiliev invariants and to vanish on holonomies of smooth connections . \\n this might be pointing to a certain `` naturalness '' of the vassiliev invariant space in the context of quantum gravity . in spite of the a priori huge ambiguity in the regularization of the singly - densitized hamiltonian , it is difficult to imagine a regularization involving the loop derivative that would not be finite on the vassiliev invariants . \\n in addition , we have not introduced in our construction any ad - hoc `` renormalization '' of the operator to obtain finiteness ( as one had to do in the doubly - densitized case ) . \\n we will now proceed to discuss the issue of the constraint algebra . \\n the operators we introduced are written purely in terms of the loop derivative and integrals along edges of the spin net . \\n one can discuss the successive action of such operators without making specific reference to a space of states on which one is acting upon . \\n such a calculation would be `` formal '' in the sense that terms arising in it could fail to be well defined when acting on particular spaces of states . \\n this is the underlying philosophy of the kind of ( unregulated ) formal calculations some of us undertook in reference @xcite . \\n such an approach can be pursued with the regulated operators we introduce in this paper . \\n the fact that the operators are regulated and that they might act on the space of diffeomorphism invariant states will imply certain departures from the specifics of the calculations of reference @xcite . \\n if one pursues calculations at this level of generality , one can not expect to reproduce the classical poisson algebra at the level of quantum commutators without making some assumptions about the distributional behavior of the various quantities involved in the calculations . \\n one will recover terms that correspond to the classical ones but generically there will be additional terms . \\n when one particularizes to a certain `` habitat '' of wavefunctions , these extra terms in many cases will vanish . \\n however , it is not excluded that on certain habitats pathologies could appear . it would be an interesting exercise to pursue the calculation in general and then particularize to various `` habitats '' . \\n this , however , is a complex and lengthy calculation in terms of loop calculus . we will not attempt a calculation at this level of generality here . in this paper \\n we will concentrate on computing the constraint algebra on a series of habitats on which we recover the classical constraint algebra at the level of quantum commutators . \\n these habitats will include as particular cases spaces of diffeomorphism invariant functions on which the appropriate algebra will be recovered . \\n a point to be addressed when studying the constraint algebra is that , given the action of the hamiltonian constraint we have introduced , if one starts with a function of spin networks , when one acts with a hamiltonian constraint one ends with a more general object . \\n this can be explicitly seen for instance in equation ( [ nu ] ) . \\n what we see is that the result of the action of a hamiltonian on a function of spin networks is a function of spin networks times a `` vertex function '' , that is , a function dependent on the position of the vertex where the hamiltonian acts . if one wishes to compute the constraint algebra , the action of the second operator in the calculation of the algebra therefore takes place on such a space of functions . \\n one can view these functions as simply more general functions of spin networks , since after all the information of the position of the vertices comes with a given spin network . \\n this is possible , but one has to exhibit that dependence -of the vertices on the spin networks- in an explicit enough way that operators like the loop derivative have an appropriate action on such a dependence . \\n one is initially tempted to say that the loop derivative simply ignores the extra factors , since they do not appear to contain an explicit loop dependence . \\n but the position of the vertices depends on the edges of the spin network ( more precisely , a vertex is defined by the intersection point of at least three edges of the net ) , and therefore the vertex function should be affected by the loop derivative operator . to operate with the loop derivative over this kind of functions , \\n we need to make more explicit the implicit functional dependence @xmath120 $ ] of the vertex function . \\n we limit the analysis to the case of trivalent vertices . given three arbitrary open paths @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) with a common origin @xmath123 , we define the quantity , @xmath124 where @xmath125 denotes generically the three curves @xmath126 , @xmath127 is @xmath128 if @xmath129 and zero otherwise , and @xmath130 is a scalar function defined on the manifold . \\n it is assumed that the three paths are oriented and we denote by the overbar the path in the reversed orientation . \\n we also assume that , starting at @xmath123 , the three curves overlap in a finite segment and then they separate following disjoint paths , as it is shown in the figure . \\n we call @xmath26 the bifurcation point of the three curves . \\n it is immediate to show that , @xmath131 and , @xmath132 the above expressions can be used to calculate the loop derivative of a vertex function . given a vertex of the net with edges @xmath133 , we identify the portion of the curve @xmath121 going form @xmath26 to the end point with the portion of the edge @xmath96 from the vertex to some intermediate point . \\n this automatically guarantees that the point @xmath26 defined through the family of curves @xmath121 coincides with the chosen vertex of the graph . if the end points of the edges @xmath134 lie outside of the ball of radius @xmath30 centered at @xmath26 , then one has the identity @xmath135 \\n .    we can now proceed to compute explicitly the loop derivative . for any function @xmath136 we have ( @xcite chapter 1 ) , @xmath137z } f(z).\\\\label{loopder}\\\\ ] ] using this result it is straightforward to calculate the loop

the loop derivative of a vertex function , we can consider the construction of a `` habitat '' of functions of spin networks with marked points of the definite following kind : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a group factor depending on the spins of the edges incident at @xmath26 . \\n this type of dependence on the vertex is precisely the one that appears in the action of the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hame2 ] ) . in the last identity \\n , we express the relationship between @xmath143 and @xmath144 through an operator @xmath145 . \\n it is clear that , in the limit @xmath19 , one gets as a result a function of the spin network times a function of the vertices and incoming spins , @xmath146 to define the action of the constraints on these kinds of functions we will study the action of the constraints before taking the limit @xmath19 in these expressions in a suitable way . \\n let us start by considering the diffeomorphism constraint , @xmath147\\\\,.\\\\end{aligned}\\\\

order in which the limits are taken . \\n if one takes the limit @xmath19 first , one finds that the diffeomorphism annihilates @xmath149 . \\n this means that @xmath150 . on the other hand , \\n if we take the limit @xmath151 first one gets the result , @xmath152 r_{c}(1,\\\\epsilon , e ) + o(\\\\epsilon),\\\\ ] ] and , @xmath153 with this choice we see that the action of the diffeomorphism is what one would have expected geometrically : it lie - drags the dependence of @xmath91 on the position of the vertex . \\n this action immediately ensures that the action of the diffeomorphism constraint closes the appropriate commutator algebra on the space of functions we are considering , provided @xmath144 is either invariant ( like in the case of the vassiliev invariants ) or is such that the diffeomorphism constraint has the natural geometric action . in the general case , \\n @xmath154    based on these calculations for the diffeomorphism , let us now explore the action of the hamiltonian constraint on the habitat we have been discussing . from ( [ hgen ] ) and ( [ derr ] ) we get ( @xmath155 is now the scale parameter of the triangulation adapted to the spin network ) ,

will discuss this in detail in the next section .      in the classical theory , the poisson bracket of two smeared hamiltonian constraints \\n is given by , @xmath162 with the one - form @xmath163 and @xmath164 is the ( unsmeared ) diffeomorphism constraint . \\n that is , the right hand side of this expression is a diffeomorphism generated by the vector obtained by contracting the one - form @xmath165 with a double - contravariant metric . \\n if one wishes this expression to have a quantum counterpart , it implies realizing the product of the doubly contravariant metric times a diffeomorphism as a quantum operator . in order to do this , \\n we need to re - express it in terms of variables that are suitable for the ashtekar formulation . \\n this is done via the following classical identities , as discussed by thiemann @xcite , @xmath166 and we recall the relationship of the covariant ( undensitized ) triads with the more usual contravariant densitized triads , @xmath167 . \\n we can now use the key identity , due to thiemann , @xmath168 to obtain , @xmath169    this expression can not be easily promoted in a direct way to an operator due to the denominators involving the determinant of the metric . \\n we can achieve this noting that the poisson bracket of the connection and the volume depends only on local information of the volume operator in the surrounding of the point @xmath17 . \\n we can therefore replace in the above expression the volume of the whole manifold @xmath9 , by a `` localized '' volume ( as discussed by thiemann @xcite )

following identity holds , @xmath174 and in addition , @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the euclidean volume of the infinitesimal region @xmath177 given by a fiducial flat metric ( we will see that the final result does not depend on the fiducial metric ) . \\n the above expressions allow us to absorb the denominators involving the determinant of the metric into poisson brackets . using this results we write ( [ metc ] ) in the form , @xmath178 we now discretize the integral introducing the triangulation @xmath179 of space defined in section ii , @xmath180 where we have identified @xmath181 to simplify the notation . using ( [ vol ] ) \\n we replace the @xmath182 and @xmath183 in terms of the volume of the elementary regions and the edges @xmath184 of the tetrahedra , and we join four of the @xmath184 s with the @xmath185 s to construct holonomies along the edges of the triangulation , @xmath186 where we have defined , @xmath187 { \\\\rm tr}[\\\\tau^k

wavefunctions , which we assume to be the loop transform of a state in the connection representation . as in the case of the hamiltonian constraint , \\n we adapt the triangulation to the graph of the spin network choosing the points @xmath24 of the boxes @xmath188 coincident with the vertices of the spin network , and we choose the regions @xmath189 equal to that defined by the triangulation around @xmath26 but with a length scale @xmath155 . with this prescriptions we get from ( [ metc2 ] ) , @xmath190 where we have used ( [ tangent ] ) and @xmath191 with @xmath30 the length scale of the regions @xmath29 . \\n the action of the operator @xmath192 on the spin network wavefunctions is calculated as usual through its action on the wilson net appearing in the loop transform . \\n it is important to notice that this operator looses all dependence with the scale parameters involved in the triangulation and the localized volume . \\n this is due to the fact that , acting on the wilson net , the holonomies @xmath193 that appear in the quantum version of ( [ q ] ) generate ( in the limit @xmath194 ) finite recoupling coefficients and that the action of the volume operator is local ( it depends only on the vertex included in the region @xmath195 .    with this result at hand it is straightforward to quantize the right hand side of the poisson bracket of two smeared hamiltonian constraints . from the classical expression we immediately write , @xmath196 f_{\\\\delta}(x , y ) \\\\delta_{cb}^{(e)}(\\\\pi_y^x ) \\\\psi(s)\\\\ , , \\\\nonumber\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] where we have used the regularized expression of the unsmeared diffeomorphism operator ( see the companion paper , section ii.b ) . \\n introducing now the regularized metric operator we get , @xmath197

two regularization parameters @xmath30 and @xmath155 . \\n the latter was introduced , as we discussed above , in the definition of the localized volume operator . \\n this ambiguity , associated with the fact that the localized volume and the ordinary one are the same on these spaces of functions was first noticed by lewandowski and discussed in @xcite . if one chooses @xmath198 one notices quickly that the expression for the right - hand - side vanishes . \\n the powers @xmath199 cancel and one is left with two integrals along @xmath200 , @xmath201 which are of order @xmath30 each . \\n the rest of the expression is simply the action of a diffeomorphism . assuming that the latter is finite , the expression therefore vanishes . \\n if we trace back the origin of this cancellation , one notices that the expression ( [ metq ] ) for the contravariant metric operator vanishes identically over spin network states of any kind , in particular , the vassiliev invariants we are considering in this paper . \\n this property is a consequence of the following two peculiarities of the quantization of @xmath202 in terms of spin network wavefunctions : the sum over the triangulation reduces to a sum over the vertices of the spin net ( which includes a finite number of terms ) , and in each term the result of @xmath203 is finite . notice \\n that in the classical result ( [ metc ] ) one has an infinite sum of @xmath204 , each of which tends to zero in the limit @xmath205 . \\n this limit gives in general a nonzero result . \\n but in ( [ metq ] ) we have instead a finite sum of terms @xmath203 , which are independent of @xmath30 and @xmath155 . \\n this fact alters the power counting of the factors @xmath30 and @xmath155 in such a way that all the terms tends naturally ( i.e. choosing @xmath198 ) to zero as the triangulation shrinks to a point .    that the right - hand - side may vanish was already observed in @xcite . \\n could one `` tune '' the limits in @xmath30 and @xmath155 so this quantity is nonvanishing ? one could , but the result would be dependent on the background structures introduced to regularize . \\n if one made the expression non - vanishing it would be proportional to the normalized tangent vectors at the intersection , which are background dependent . \\n this is not surprising : there is no naturally defined second order symmetric contravariant tensor defined in a manifold without metric . \\n this result is quite strong . \\n it implies that the commutator of two hamiltonians will have to vanish if one wishes to have consistency . \\n we anticipated that this would happen in the previous subsection and we will now see in detail how it happens . \\n as a final remark , we notice that if one wished to define the doubly covariant metric , it is straightforward to compute it using the identities introduced by thiemann and one finds that regularized with the same procedures we followed up to now , it diverges . should one worry about a theory of quantum gravity where the doubly contravariant metric vanishes and the doubly covariant metric diverges ? \\n we will return to this in the discussion section . \\n the loop derivative was originally introduced in the context of yang \\n mills theories , where the natural functions to act upon were holonomies of smooth connections . these functions are not the most natural ones to consider in the context of diffeomorphism invariant theories like general relativity , but our constraints are well defined on them , so we can consider them to be a `` habitat '' where to test the constraint algebra , at least as a mathematical exercise . on these kinds of functions \\n the diffeomorphism constraints that we have introduced here are known to close the appropriate algebra in the limit in which regulators are removed ( see @xcite , although the regularization is slightly different than the one we use in this paper , it is immediate to check that the same calculations go through ) . \\n we therefore will not repeat the calculation here . \\n the hamiltonian constraint vanishes identically on this habitat . \\n starting from equation ( [ hgen ] ) , if the loop derivative is a smooth function , one is left with two one - dimensional integrals along the edges of a cell of a finite function . in the limit in which the triangulation is shrank , the result vanishes . \\n the commutator of a diffeomorphism with a hamiltonian therefore immediately reproduces the classical result .    the right - hand side of the commutator of two hamiltonians that we introduced in the previous subsection also vanishes , here one has three one dimensional integrals along the edges of a triangulation of a quantity that goes as @xmath206 . \\n the final result therefore goes as @xmath207 . \\n therefore , as long as one chooses @xmath155 shrinking to zero faster than @xmath208 , the right hand side vanishes .    on this space \\n therefore , we reproduce the classical poisson algebra at the level of the commutators \\n . the diffeomorphisms close among themselves and the hamiltonian vanishes identically . \\n could one simply claim that this is the `` right '' habitat to do quantum gravity ? \\n the answer is that this is unlikely . \\n although all states are solutions of the hamiltonian constraint , this space does not contain any solution to the diffeomorphism constraint . \\n solutions to the diffeomorphism constraint in terms of holonomies can only be constructed as infinite superpositions , functional integrals or `` group averaging '' , and in these cases one includes connections that are not smooth . \\n an interesting point is that in this habitat , since one does not have solutions of the diffeomorphism constraint but has solutions to the hamiltonian constraint , the only way that one could achieve consistency in the algebra is if the right hand side of the commutator of two hamiltonians vanishes , which is the case . \\n another point to consider is that if one examines the expression of the commutator of two hamiltonians , although both members vanish in the limit in which one shrinks the triangulation given the smoothness of the loop derivative away from the limit the calculation is problematic . \\n for instance , it is not clear what is the action of the volume operator on a state given by the loop derivative of a smooth holonomy . \\n one might consider introducing a definition of the volume on this kind of space , but this has yet to be done in detail . \\n remarkably , this space of invariants also leads to a reproduction of the classical poisson algebra at a trivial level only ( as usual , we limit our discussion to trivalent intersections ) . \\n this is based on the fact proved in the appendix of the previous paper , that these invariants are annihilated by the loop derivative that appears in both the diffeomorphism and the hamiltonian constraints and of the expression of the rhs . \\n therefore the ambient isotopic ( framing - independent ) vassiliev invariants for spin networks with trivalent intersections are annihilated by all the constraints of quantum gravity and consistently , by the right hand side of the commutator of two hamiltonian constraints . \\n it should be pointed out that the space is in no way trivial : as we discussed in the appendix of the previous paper , the annihilation is a detailed property of the space of vassiliev invariants , related to the decomposition of the invariants in framing independent and framing dependent components and the detailed structure of chord diagrams appearing in the coefficients . \\n hints that the vassiliev invariants for trivalent intersections were annihilated by the hamiltonian constraint were found for the lower invariants in terms of loops @xcite,@xcite , in the lattice @xcite . \\n one could mention as a more trivial example of a space with similar property the states based on diffeomorphism invariants of spin networks with no vertices , which are also trivially annihilated by all the constraints we consider . \\n this is an extension of results also first suggested in the context of loops @xcite . \\n it should be remarked that this property of the loop derivative is not true for higher valence intersections . \\n future extensions of the hamiltonian constraint to higher valence intersections could be tested in this habitat for non - trivial consistency .      by this space \\n we mean the invariants that appear in the power series expansion of the expectation value of the wilson net in a chern  simons theory in terms of the inverse coupling constant @xmath209 . \\n in particular , the whole series is an example of such an invariant . \\n each coefficient of the series and certain portions of them are also examples . in general , \\n these invariants are sums and products of the independent invariants that appear at each order , both framing - independent and framing - dependent ( see previous paper ) . \\n these states have the important property that the loop derivative that appears in the expressions of the constraints ( which is evaluated on a path @xmath16 of infinitesimal length ) can be rewritten simply as , @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the edge of the spin net containing the point @xmath17 and where the invariant @xmath212 is another vassiliev invariant of one order less than @xmath213 . \\n what happens is that because of the infinitesimal length of @xmath16 one can rearrange the action of the loop derivative in terms of the original spin network @xmath52 using recoupling identities , at the expense of some additional group factors , which we reabsorb notationally in @xmath212 . \\n we will see that we do not need the details of the relation of @xmath213 to @xmath212 for proving the consistency . as usual , all our discussion is limited to trivalent intersections . \\n the relation above implies that for the vassiliev invariants , one can write , @xmath214 this can be seen by considering equation ( [ nu ] ) and recalling that @xmath215 . \\n in particular , we see that the action of the hamiltonian on these states can be written ( up to a constant factor which we will omit for simplicity ) as , @xmath216      on this space , the diffeomorphism constraint vanishes identically , as we discussed in the previous paper . \\n so the algebra of diffeomorphisms is trivially satisfied . \\n nontrivial commutators to be realized will be those of a diffeomorphism with a hamiltonian and that of two hamiltonians .      in the case of a diffeomorphism with a hamiltonian , \\n since the wavefunctions are diffeomorphism invariant , of the two terms of the commutator one is left with the one in which the diffeomorphism acts at the left . \\n since the action of the hamiltonian on @xmath213 is not diffeomorphism invariant , one should recover the proper action of the diffeomorphism through such term . here \\n the derivations of section [ marked ] become useful . \\n we start from the expression ( [ honvas ] ) , and then use ( [ diffeoono ] ) to get , @xmath217 and from here the correct commutator follows immediately . \\n this implies that the quantum hamiltonian transforms covariantly in a correct way . \\n this calculation is one of the main differences of our construction with respect to the one of thiemann @xcite , since in that context one does not consider an infinitesimal generator of diffeomorphisms . \\n as we discussed in section [ marked ] , the action of a hamiltonian on a function with marked points as one gets after acting with a hamiltonian on a vassiliev invariant was given by expression ( [ [ ho ] ] ) , which we can combine with the action of the hamiltonian ( [ honvas ] ) to get , @xmath218 and if one performs the calculation in the reverse order , one obtains the @xmath103 operators in the reverse order . \\n however , these operators are multiplicative , so they commute . \\n therefore one has the result , @xmath219 v_n(s)=0,\\\\ ] ] which is the expected commutation relation on states that are invariant under diffeomorphisms . \\n the states we have already considered , where one has a vassiliev invariant times a scalar function that depends on the position of the vertices of the spin network , are an attractive habitat where the diffeomorphism constraint does not vanish .      as discussed in section ( [ marked ] ) the diffeomorphisms on these states reduce to lie dragging of the scalar functions of the vertices ( see formula ( [ diffeoono ] ) ) . \\n since they correspond to a natural geometric action , the consistency of the algebra of diffeomorphisms is immediate . \\n we start from the action of a hamiltonian on these kinds of states , @xmath220 where we have used the fact that @xmath221 and @xmath222 commute and that the action of the hamiltonian on these states produces a vassiliev invariant of order lowered by one unit times a vertex function . \\n we now act with a diffeomorphism , @xmath223 and now use the fact that leibniz rule applies to the action of the diffeomorphism constraint ( stemming from the fact that it also applies to the action of the loop derivative ) , @xmath224 and we now reconstruct the hamiltonian in the first and second terms , @xmath225 and using the fact that @xmath222 and @xmath221 commute , we get , @xmath226 which we can rewrite as , @xmath227 from where we get the correct commutation relation , @xmath228 o(m,\\\\omega ) v_n   =   h(l^a \\\\partial_a n ) o(m,\\\\omega ) v_{n}.\\\\ ] ] \\n this calculation proceeds along the same lines as the one in the previous subsection , we essentially rewrite the action of the hamiltonian in terms of the @xmath221 operator , and note that the @xmath221 operators commute , @xmath229 and we therefore get that @xmath230=0 $ ] , which as we discussed before , is consistent with the representation in these spaces of functions of the right hand side of the quantum commutator . \\n we have presented a canonical quantization of the constraints of canonical general relativity . \\n we represented the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints using two novel ingredients : the loop derivative to represent the field tensor @xmath14 and the use of spaces related to the generalization of the vassiliev invariants to spin networks ( restricted to trivalent intersections ) as wavefunctions . in terms of the latter we constructed several `` habitats '' , including spaces of functions that are not invariant under diffeomorphisms and we checked that one obtained a consistent algebra of quantum commutators of the constraints . consistency in this sense \\n implies that the quantization of the canonical poisson identities between the classical constraints is implemented correctly in the quantization . \\n we have observed that this consistency is achieved at the price of having a vanishing right hand - side for the commutator of two hamiltonians and that we can trace back this fact to the vanishing nature of the doubly covariant metric operator in these spaces of functions . \\n we should point out common elements and differences with the quantization presented by thiemann @xcite . in thiemann \\n s case the hamiltonian was implemented on the space of diffeomorphism invariant cylindrical functions of spin networks . on these spaces \\n one does not have a well defined notion of the field tensor @xmath14 and the functions are not loop - differentiable . in our case \\n , the availability of the loop derivatives allows to have at hand a `` differential calculus '' that allows for several novel constructions . \\n examples of them are the calculations performed in computing the constraint algebra , and the possibility of finding novel solutions to the hamiltonian constraint , based on the behavior of the vassiliev invariants under loop differentiation . \\n another difference involves the implementation of an infinitesimal generator of diffeomorphisms . in thiemann s original construction \\n one worked directly in terms of diffeomorphism invariant states and therefore one did not have an infinitesimal generator . \\n the construction was extended by lewandowski and marolf @xcite to `` habitats '' that are dependent on diffeomorphisms . with that extension \\n , thiemann s work achieves the same level of consistency that we have in this paper , in the sense that one can check non - trivial commutators of diffeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms with hamiltonians . \\n one still has the feature of a vanishing right hand side of the commutator of two hamiltonians @xcite . as we discussed in this paper \\n , this feature appears as inescapable in the context of wavefunctions only dependent on spin networks as the ones we considered here , since as we mentioned one does not have enough structures to construct a naturally defined symmetric metric tensor . \\n other differences arise insofar as the space of wavefunctions considered . in the case of thiemann \\n , one had spaces of functions with well defined inner products , which allow to discuss normalizability and study the spaces of solutions with a level of rigor that is not available currently in our approach , since we do not have an inner product on the habitats we are considering . \\n it might not be impossible to find a suitable inner product with the same techniques that led to the construction of the measures on the spaces of cylindrical functions , but it has not been achieved yet . \\n concerning solutions of the constraints , one has some available both in our approach and in thiemann s , that appear as quite distinct in their features . in thiemann s \\n approach , the solutions are obtained using group averaging techniques . \\n this leads to structures like `` tassels '' and others @xcite in which accumulation of lines and vertices take place . in our approach \\n , one has a number of solutions of the hamiltonian constraint ( the framing independent vassiliev invariants for trivalent intersections ) that do not depend on such structures . on the other hand , they appear as `` trivial '' solutions in the sense that they may not exist if one considers intersections of higher valences . in our approach \\n one may also construct solutions to the hamiltonian constraint with a cosmological constant , following similar ideas that led to the construction of states in terms of loops @xcite . \\n although we have not pursued this in detail yet , it appears quite plausible that these types of solutions exist , given the structure of the extra term due to the cosmological constant in the hamiltonian constraint in terms of the spin network approach @xcite . \\n thiemann s approach has also been studied in @xmath231 dimensions @xcite , and appears to lead to a satisfactory quantization , provided one chooses in an ad - hoc way an inner product that rules out certain infinite dimensional set of solutions . in a forthcoming paper \\n we will discuss the quantization of @xmath231 dimensional gravity using an approach that has elements in common with the one we pursue here , in particular the requirement of loop differentiability of the states . \\n we will see that this requirement limits us ( at least for low valence intersections ) to the correct solution space in a natural way . \\n the reader might find unsatisfactory that the right hand side of the commutator of two hamiltonians vanishes . \\n even more unsatisfactory may appear the fact that this is due to the vanishing of the doubly covariant metric in this approach to quantum gravity . in this subsection \\n we will address this and other issues . \\n the first question that one may raise is if this is not just a pathology that is introduced by our limitation to trivalent intersections for reasons of calculational convenience . \\n after all , one knows that this subspace in in some sense degenerate since the volume operator vanishes identically . \\n unfortunately , it appears unlikely that extending our results to higher valent intersections ( to which we do not see any technical obstruction , apart from greater calculational complexity ) will change things insofar as the commutator of two hamiltonians . \\n the action of the hamiltonian constraint on higher valent intersections is more complicated largely because the volume operator and the action of the loop derivative can not be reduced to a simple group - dependent prefactor times the original state , but will in general involve a linear combination of states , with a non - trivial group - dependent matrix of coefficients \\n . however , the dependence of the hamiltonian on the smearing function will remain as a multiplicative one . \\n therefore it appears that the commutator of two hamiltonians will again vanish . \\n moreover , the reasons we gave for the vanishing of the right hand side of the commutator are independent of the valences of the intersections of the spin networks . \\n the expression for the doubly - covariant metric will be more complicated , but will still include a prefactor with the same dependence on the regulators as in the trivalent case and it will vanish . \\n one therefore expects consistency at the same level we achieved for the trivalent case . \\n can one consider satisfactory a theory with a vanishing doubly contravariant metric ( and a divergent doubly covariant metric ) ? \\n the answer to this will only appear in a definitive way when one constructs physical predictions from the theory , which at the moment are lacking . \\n one can get partial indications that the pathology might not be as severe as it appears at first sight from the fact that one can define reasonable quantities like areas , volumes and lengths in this framework in spite of having the ill defined metric operators . \\n an attractive feature of the vassiliev states is that other diffeomorphism invariant operators can be defined as well . for instance , if one considers the integral @xmath232 , given that the chern \\n simons states are such that the densitized triads are proportional to the magnetic vector constructed from the curvature , one finds that quantum representation of this integral is identical to the volume operator . \\n an important observation concerning how satisfatory is a theory with a vanishing metric operator like the one we propose is that in @xmath231-dimensional gravity similar pathologies appear , yet the correct physical theory is recovered . if one pursues a quantization similar to thiemann s dimensional gravity along the same lines as the one proposed in this paper , and the observations we make in this subsection apply to it as well . \\n we will also expand the discussion on the physical observables and their connection with the kinematical metric we present in this subsection . ] in @xmath231=dimensions ( this is discussed in detail in @xcite ) one notices that the hamiltonians also commute . \\n moreover , the geometrical arguments leading to the vanishing of the @xmath202 operator still hold in this context : there is no quantity one can build out of loop states that will yield a doubly contravariant symmetric tensor . \\n yet , it was shown in @xcite that one can recover the correct physical theory . how can these apparently contradictory elements be reconciled ? it has to do with the nature of the kinematical calculations we are performing . to check the `` off shell '' contraint algrebra one \\n is required to operate with a kinematial space of wavefunctions that are not annihilated by the constraints . \\n when one recovers `` physics '' one should really do it with states that are annihilated by the constraint . \\n this can be carried out in detail in the @xmath231 dimensional case . \\n suppose one wishes to ask questions about the `` metric '' of the theory . \\n the first observation is that on physical states one can not define a metric tensor since the latter states are diffeomorphism invariant and the metric tensor is not . \\n one could gauge fix a metric tensor , say by asking questions about the value of its components in a fixed coordinate system . \\n these questions can be answered : the components of the metric in a fixed coordinate system can be related to the values of the invariant operators @xmath233 and @xmath234 in such a coordinate system ( and therefore in general , since the latter are coordinate invariant ) . \\n one therefore has well defined operators associated with the metric that can be evaluated in the physical space of states . \\n but such operators have little to do with the @xmath202 we introduced in the kinematical space . \\n it is not obvious at all that the two operators will be related in any way since the former are non - vanishing whereas the latter vanishes identically . \\n there is a certain disquieting element in the last observation , since it seems to imply that one should be careful before drawing conclusions from calculations at a kinematical level . \\n this in particular , implies all calculations involving the constraint algebra . when we set out to work on the current paper , our expectation was that reproducing the contraint algebra would be a strong test for our quantization procedure , that perhaps would rule out all but a few of the possible theories . \\n what we have learned is that this is probably not the correct view on the issue : one can obtain consistency in many ways at a kinematical level ( in particular with @xmath235 ) . \\n one can construct many consistent theories of quantum gravity . and still , what the @xmath231 dimensional example shows is that the `` physics '' of all these theories is really deeply buried in the states that solve the constraints . in a sense this is good , \\n since the theory we are proposing here differs significantly at this level from the one proposed by thiemann and therefore further adds to our options for trying to match experimental results . \\n the observation that kinematical calculations may have quite nontrivial connections with `` real physics '' poses problems for computations that try to obtain heuristic physical insights from looking at properties of the kinematical states ( the `` weave '' approach to the semiclassical theory ) . \\n an example of this are our own results on gamma - ray - burst light dispersion @xcite . from the @xmath231 example \\n we see that quantum fluctuations in the `` physical metric '' ( the ones one would expect to influence the propagation of matter fields ) may not have a direct connection with fluctuations of the kinematical metric . yet it is the latter that are used in the concrete computations of @xcite . \\n concerning the latter point , it is worthwhile mentioning explicitly that the theory presented in this paper can be coupled to matter and have well defined expressions for the hamiltonians of matter fields , which also involve the metric in a non - trivial way ( the coupling of the theory to matter can , for instance , be achieved using the same construction as thiemann @xcite ; or one could consider alternative settings in which the loop derivative is also used in the representation of certain matter fields ) . \\n it is somewhat unfortunate that the remarkable results on black hole entropy that have been achieved within this context @xcite do not involve in a detailed way the action of the hamiltonian constraint in the `` bulk '' of the spacetime to be used as guideline for constructing the constraints , and therefore can not distinguish at the moment our proposal from thiemann s . \\n the vanishing of the doubly contravariant metric tensor , apart from appearing as a `` robust '' feature based only on elementary notions of covariance of the elements involved in constructing the spin network states , is the way in which our approach bypasses the `` hermiticity problem '' of the canonical quantization . as we mentioned , if one were to demand that the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints and the doubly covariant metric be hermitian operators ( since they correspond to real classical quantities ) \\n , the commutator of two hamiltonians ( which is hermitian ) can not be simply equal to the product of a metric times a diffeomorphism ( which is not hermitian ) . \\n one could fix the hermiticity of the right hand side by `` symmetrizing '' the operator , but then one could face an anomaly problem , since the diffeomorphism constraint would not act to the right of the product . \\n this difficulty is bypassed ( in the context of non - diffeomorphism invariant states ) if the metric vanishes . \\n it should be noticed that it is not obvious that one should promote the constraints to hermitian operators , for instance , see @xcite for counterexamples in the context of the quantization of non - unimodular gauge groups . \\n related with the issue of the lack of guidelines to construct the theory is the problem of uniqueness . \\n we already have a manifest non - uniqueness in that the theory presented here and the theory introduced by thiemann appear as both satisfactory yet distinct . \\n the ambiguity is worse than this . even if one stays within one general approach , for instance considering the space of vassiliev invariants as `` arena '' for quantization , \\n there are many ways in which one could implement the hamiltonian constraint . \\n we have not analyzed them in any detail , but some salient features of them are worthwhile mentioning . \\n the ambiguities arise in the various limits involved in constructing the hamiltonian . \\n one of them is associated with the specific action of the loop derivative . \\n the loop derivative is dependent on a path . in this paper \\n we have taken such a path to coincide with one of the lines of the spin network . \\n we then acted with the loop derivative and collapsed its action using recoupling identities . \\n the final action of the hamiltonian was therefore `` ultra - local '' in the sense that it returned a wavefunction with the same vertex structure times a vertex dependent prefactor ( for valences higher than three one gets a linear combination with different spin weights for the intertwiners yet the topology of the vertex is unchanged ) . \\n this may raise concerns that `` super - selections '' could appear in the sense that it could be easy to construct operators that commute with the hamiltonian . \\n one could define a different hamiltonian in a straightforward way , by assuming a different topology for the path associated with the loop derivative . \\n for instance , one could assume that the path starts at the vertex , advances along one of the edges of the spin network and then crosses towards another edge of the spin network along one of the edges of the tetrahedra introduced in the discretization . \\n at the end of the path , the loop derivative acts . \\n one then is left with an action of the hamiltonian resembling the one introduced by thiemann : the constraint produces a vertex dependent prefactor , but it also alters the structure of the spin network by `` adding a line '' at the vertex . \\n a different proposal would be to have a path that starts at the vertex , advances along one of the edges of the spin network , crosses towards another edge along the tetrahedron and then continues to cross towards another edge of the spin network , as shown in figure [ fifi ] .    in the first of these proposals ( as in thiemann s ) , the hamiltonian adds vertices called `` exceptional '' in the sense that they are planar vertices . \\n the hamiltonian vanishes identically on such vertices , because the volume vanishes on planar vertices , even if they are four - valent . in the second proposal , \\n the intermediate vertex that is created is non - planar . \\n this might raise hopes that the commutator of two hamiltonians may be less trivial , since the second hamiltonian acts at the newly created vertex , but more careful analyses seem to indicate that the hamiltonians still commute @xcite . \\n if it they were not to commute one would still be faced with how to reproduce a similar vertex structure with the right hand side operator in a natural way . summarizing this portion of the discussion \\n : it appears that there is a non - trivial , possibly infinite , amount of ambiguity in the definition of the theory , that is not significantly constrained by the imposition of the correct quantum commutator algebra . \\n related to the latter point is the fact that due to the vanishing of the metric , the consistency check provided by the commutator of two hamiltonians is less detailed than if one had to prove the equality of non - vanishing operators . \\n we already see that we have two distinct and apparently consistent , quantizations of the constraints ( with several possible variants of each ) . \\n it will require further study to determine if one quantization is `` better '' in the sense of reproducing expected results than the other . \\n one possibility would be to consider the commutation of the hamiltonian with various operators , and study if inconsistencies appear . \\n this procedure , however , might be limited by the fact that most commutators have non - trivial right hand sides which will inevitably involve quite a bit of ambiguity at the time of their quantization . \\n another point that might be raised is that these approaches appear confined to four dimensions and to the einstein - hilbert action , and therefore one may have little hopes of making contact with other approaches , as those based on string theories . \\n these approaches not only may present avenues to understand quantum gravity but they also have the attractive feature of unifying gravity with other interactions , a goal some may consider desirable in itself . \\n it should be pointed out however , that progress is being made @xcite towards describing @xmath236 dimensional general relativity in terms of connections . \\n although constructions like the ones we discussed here have not been pursued in detail in this context , they appear as plausible . \\n to conclude , we have at the moment canonical quantizations of general relativity ( possibly coupled to matter ) that appear as mathematically consistent at the kinematical level at which they have been studied . \\n this level of consistency had never been achieved before in other approaches . \\n further exploration of the consequences of the quantization will be needed to determine if any of them are physically satisfactory theories of the quantum gravitational field . in particular the exploration of \\n the space of states that solve the constraints and how physical quantities can be evaluated on them appears as a natural next step in the quantization program . \\n we wish to thank abhay ashtekar , laurent freidel , john klauder ,

[ \\n fig : figure2 ] ) . \\n the absence of thermalization is not due to fine - tuning but arises from an emergent integrability . \\n this integrability is encoded in ( quasi- ) local integrals of motion ( liom s ) , also referred to as l - bits ( for localized )  @xcite . \\n we will see in the remainder of this letter that the combination of the aforementioned phenomena , i.e. , violation of eth , the change in level statistics , and the emergent integrability will largely influence the decoherence properties of the attached probe spin @xcite .    a lot of recent work in the field of interacting disordered systems has been devoted to devising observable criteria for the mbl transition . \\n as opposed to direct measurements of the mbl system , here , we present an alternate view : we use an external spin to probe the mbl system described by eq . \\n [ eq : environmenthamiltonian ] . \\n in particular , we show that the decoherence of the external spin provides unambiguous signatures of mbl and directly manifests the fundamental logarithmic growth  @xcite of the entanglement entropy expected in mbl systems . \\n the hamiltonian of the full system reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 is given in eqn . \\n ( [ eq : environmenthamiltonian ] ) and @xmath14 describes the environment - probe interaction \\n . this interaction hamiltonian is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the operator describing the probe spin . \\n we do not include any intrinsic hamiltonian for the probe spin since we are fundamentally interested in the decoherence rather than relaxation . \\n however , a magnetic field acting on the spin along the @xmath18 direction induces a pure phase factor and does not play a role in what will be discussed below \\n . we will primarily discuss the coupling of the probe spin to one end of the chain , i.e. @xmath19 and all other @xmath20 are set to zero . as opposed to an infinite range coupling of the spin to disordered baths , which is not particularly sensitive to localization @xcite , by coupling the test - spin to a single site we will be susceptible to localization and the associated emergent integrability of the mbl phase . \\n let us now discuss this decoherence dynamics . \\n at time @xmath21 , we assume the combined system to be in a factorizable initial density matrix @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the density matrix of the environment . \\n the probe spin is initialized in a pure state @xmath24 with @xmath25 . \\n this choice of initial state and interaction terms leads to a pure decoherence of the probe spin . \\n turning on the coupling at @xmath26 , the total density matrix undergoes the usual hamiltonian time evolution . in the basis @xmath27 , \\n the time evolved reduced density matrix @xmath28 of the probe spin can be formally expressed as @xmath29 the factor @xmath30 is the measure of the spin coherence at time @xmath31 . \\n we will be mostly concerned with the disorder average of @xmath32 , which we denote with an overbar as @xmath33 . \\n the expression in eq . \\n is closely related to the loschmidt echo , which is used as a measure of quantum chaos @xcite . \\n it is valid for arbitrary coupling between the probe spin and the system and goes beyond the standard born - markov approximation used in typical studies of decoherence . at asymptotic times , the coherence @xmath34 . \\n however , the transient behaviour of @xmath33 , which shows how the probe spin decoheres , may depend on the specific choice of the initial state of the environment . \\n we exploit this aspect to see if the transient behaviour of the decoherence is indeed a sensitive probe of the underlying many body localization . \\n to probe mbl , we consider three different initial states for the environment : i ) the groundstate , ii ) the infinite temperature density matrix @xmath35 and iii ) in analogy with experiments on mbl , a high - energy nel ordered state  @xcite . states ( ii ) and ( iii ) are apt choices as they emphasize the mbl aspect , since eigenstate thermalization is expected to be violated for highly excited states in particular .    in order to obtain the coherence function @xmath32 one can go along different routes . for small values of the coupling @xmath36 , where the born approximation holds \\n , the coherence is essentially determined by the end spin correlator @xmath37 @xcite . for arbitrary values of the coupling , on the other hand \\n , one can use exact numerical diagonalization methods to evaluate @xmath32 . in the following \\n , we set the exchange coupling @xmath38 , the probe coupling @xmath39 , and restrict ourselves to the total @xmath40 sector . \\n this restriction allows us to directly study the level statistics of the model . \\n moreover this constraint is physically relevant in experiments with cold atoms , where one works within a restricted spin sector . \\n we use exact diagonalization to calculate the coherence for an environment of size @xmath41 , and calculate the average @xmath33 over @xmath42 disorder realizations . \\n already for these systems sizes we observe the main features of the level statistics expected for the thermodynamic limit ( see panel @xmath11 of fig . \\n [ fig : figure2 ] ) . \\n panels @xmath43 and @xmath44 of fig . \\n [ fig : figure2 ] show results for the disorder averaged coherence of the three choices of initial states , at disorder strengths deep in the delocalized ( @xmath45 ) and localized ( @xmath46 ) regimes . for all choices of the initial state \\n , we observe starkly different behaviours of @xmath47 in the two phases . \\n the coherence decays on much shorter time scales in the delocalized regime for @xmath48 as opposed to it persisting until much longer times in the localized phases . \\n the initial nel ordered state essentially captures the envelope of the @xmath49 state coherence , up to a linear scaling of time by a factor two . \\n therefore , we focus exclusively on the nel state and analyze the different time regimes .    the real and imaginary parts of @xmath33 for the nel state in the mbl regime , corresponding to the expectation values of the probe spin in the @xmath50- and @xmath51-direction respectively , are plotted in panel @xmath52 of fig . \\n [ fig : figure2 ] . \\n the resulting absolute value @xmath53 is shown in black . \\n additionally the panel shows an approximation to @xmath53 in gray , obtained from the entropy @xmath54 of the probe spin . for times \\n @xmath55 the two curves agree . in the small @xmath32 limit \\n namely , @xmath56 can be expanded to @xmath57 ( we have set @xmath58 for simplicity ) .    on short timescales ( @xmath59 ) \\n the coherence shows a near universal gaussian decay @xmath60 for all disorder strengths , with @xmath61 having only a very weak dependence on @xmath8 ( not shown ) . \\n this is expected from a small @xmath31 expansion of the expression for @xmath32 in eq . \\n [ moft ] , in which the linear term in @xmath31 is imaginary . \\n substantial deviations arise at intermediate and longer times . \\n the slower decay of coherence in the mbl phase for @xmath62 can be explained by considering the properties of the environment . in the large disorder limit where the level statistics shows poissonian behaviour , an extensive number of local conserved integrals of motion ( lioms ) \\n are postulated to exist  @xcite . in particular , \\n if the probe spin couples dominantly to one liom ( in this case , at the end of the chain ) , any diffusion of information to the other end will require times exponential in the system size . \\n this implies that the initial coherence of the probe spin is preserved longer since it effectively rabi - oscillates with this liom at the end , ensuring that even after averaging over disorder the coherence is retained .    for intermediate times @xmath63 \\n during which most of the decoherence occurs , @xmath53 manifests a scaling behaviour for @xmath64 while no such scaling is seen for @xmath10 . specifically , @xmath32 and the entropy @xmath56 for different @xmath8 in the localized regime can be collapsed onto a single curve by rescaling the time axis @xmath31 to @xmath65 , with a disorder independent exponent @xmath66 as shown in the top panel of fig  [ fig : logfit ] . \\n an important signature of mbl is the logarithmic growth in time of the bipartite entanglement entropy  @xcite . here , as shown in fig . \\n [ fig : logfit ] , in this transient time regime , the coherence @xmath67 , implying that the entropy of the spin grows as @xmath68 . \\n concomitant with the scaling behaviour of @xmath53 discussed above , we find that the coefficient @xmath69 varies only weakly with disorder strength . \\n since the scaling implies @xmath70 , the logarithmic regime lasts for longer times as the disorder strength increases . \\n this result carries some importance , as it shows that the decoherence of the probe spin , which is relatively easy to measure , experimentally provides a direct way of measuring the logarithmic entanglement growth . \\n the difference in behaviour for the delocalized and mbl regimes can be further exemplified by looking at the coherence at representative times @xmath71 in this intermediate regime . fig . \\n [ fig : moftau ] shows the coherence values for @xmath72 and @xmath73 as a function of disorder strength , indicating a change of slope in the way these times evolve at @xmath74 . \\n the slopes of @xmath75 versus disorder strength in the mbl regime are identical , but vary strongly in the delocalized regime ( not shown ) . \\n lastly , we mention that at asymptotic times @xmath76 a new regime sets in , where @xmath77 where @xmath78 and has a slight dependence on @xmath8 for the mbl regime . \\n the curves @xmath53 in the mbl regime for different coupling strength @xmath79 are simply related by a scaling of the time @xmath80 . \\n consequently , all of the features of the coherence in the mbl regime discussed earlier can be observed for weak as well as strong coupling of the probe to the spin chain . \\n this highlights the fact that in the mbl phase , the states are localized and the strength of the coupling @xmath79 only determines that time scale over which this state is probed . at smaller @xmath8 , the system is delocalized and no such scaling holds . \\n we have checked that our conclusions hold even if the probe couples to a spin in the middle of the chain as well as larger system sizes . by studying chains with @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 sites \\n we have confirmed that ( due to the lioms ) there is little to no effect of scaling in system size . \\n to conclude , we showed that decoherence of a single spin coupled to a mbl bath is a valuable probe of many body localization . \\n we established that in the mbl phase the coherence shows scaling behaviour with respect to the strength of disorder @xmath8 as well as with the spin - system coupling constant @xmath79 . \\n the predicted logarithmic growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy in the mbl phase manifests itself directly in the logarithmic growth of the entropy or , equivalently , in a logarithmic decay of the coherence of the probe spin in the intermediate time regime . from the real time decay of the coherence , we extract clear measures which differentiate between the delocalized and mbl regimes of the environment . \\n our setup may possibly be realized in cold atom systems or more analogously in a trapped - ion system , where one has a high degree of single spin control . \\n the real - time evolution of the coherence of the probe quit for each realization of disorder can be measured in trapped ion systems using spin fluorescence . \\n we acknowledge financial support from the swiss national science foundation ( snsf ) .    43ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] \\n + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty link:\\\\doibase 10.1103/physreva.88.042102 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\\\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.93.130406 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop _ _  ( , ) link:\\\\doibase 10.1146/annurev -

magnitude and colour - colour diagrams , finding consistent results . \\n an accurate @xmath8-band calibration of the red clump giant luminosity was obtained and applied to the red giant clump of the galactic bulge @xcite , and of the large magellanic cloud @xcite . \\n our magnitudes are in the 2mass magnitude system , and we transformed the @xmath8-band magnitudes of clump giants of hipparcos @xcite to @xmath7 magnitudes using @xmath16 . \\n the resulting zero point differences should be less than 0.02 magnitudes @xcite . \\n for the ks photometry , the distance modulus to a red clump giant in the outer disk would be : @xmath17-m_{k_{\\\\rm s}}\\\\]]where we adopted @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 as the mean values for the red clump giants of the milky way disk @xcite . \\n there should be negligible metallicity dependence of these mean values because we are looking at a stellar population of the milky way disk that should be similar to that of the solar neighbourhood where hipparcos distances of clump giants were calibrated . adopting these means magnitudes and colours , and the reddening coefficients @xcite yields : \\n @xmath21    using this equation we computed the distance modulus ( and distance in kpc ) for every single clump giant candidate in the fields . \\n for the ukidss - gps @xmath8-band data the computations are the same , but with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in order to determine the disk edge we computed the distribution in distance for the clump giants in each field . \\n thus we coadded the distance distribution of fields located above and below the plane at same galactic longitude . \\n the coadded distance distribution for each longitude was analyzed non - parametrically using the local likelihood density estimation method @xcite . \\n finally , the derivative method was applied for the distribution curve . \\n this method is simple and robust , and can be used to detect the structures in the distance distribution . \\n we defined as the disk edge the outermost point of minimum derivative in each case . \\n the uncertainties were calculated with a monte carlo procedure , assuming poisson errors . \\n the uncertainties due to the photometric errors do not produce any trend in the calculations and are much smaller than the statistical error . \\n the resulting distance distributions along different lines of sight are shown in fig . \\n [ dist ] . in all fields there is a density drop in the clump giant distribution at a corresponding galactocentric distance of about 13.9  kpc ( assuming @xmath25  kpc ) , as listed in table  [ table ] . \\n we first noticed the sharp termination of the clump giant distribution in the color - magnitude diagram of the vvv field d001 ( @xmath26 ) , a very heavily reddened area located in the outskirts of the carina star forming region @xcite . \\n similar behavior is also found in ukidss - gps data for different galactic longitudes @xcite . \\n we studied low - extinction fields across the milky way disk ( see table  [ table ] ) . \\n when these were available , we selected pairs of fields located above and below the plane at the same galactic longitude , in order to account for the galactic warp , because if the disk is warped , the line of sight can leave the stellar disk before this ends . \\n for example , at @xmath27 the mean warp location is @xmath28 below the plane @xcite , so the selected vvv field d003 is conveniently located to probe the full extent of the disk . at most other longitudes explored here \\n the warp is absent , with the mean plane being at @xmath29 ( fig . \\n [ map ] ) . \\n we have also explored a few other ukidss - gps fields located at inner longitudes that yield lower distances . \\n these fields with @xmath30 were discarded because they are heavily reddened and crowded , and the photometry is not as deep as the rest , presumably due to enhanced contamination from the near - side of the inner bar . \\n systematic errors such as variations of the reddening law have not been included . \\n it is important to note that the present results are independent of models . \\n they rely on basic assumptions such as that the hipparcos stellar sample is representative of the entire the milky way disk , and that clump giants are reliable distance indicators and tracers of the old and intermediate age populations . \\n however , the besanon galactic model with a scale - length of 2.4  kpc , including a flaring and warped outer disk , with a disk cutoff at @xmath31  kpc seems to reproduce well the observed distance distributions ( see fig.[model ] ) . \\n data and model show the same features , with a sharp increase , the peak around 5  kpc and the exponential decrease . \\n the edge is detected in the data and model at the expected place within the errors [ @xmath32  kpc ( corresponding to @xmath33  kpc ) , and @xmath34  kpc ( @xmath35  kpc ) , respectively ] . \\n a few studies have discussed the edge of the milky way towards the anticentre region previously . \\n the old galactic disk apparently does not extend beyond 14  kpc on the basis of optical @xmath36 vs. @xmath37 colour - magnitude diagrams and star counts @xcite , which does not contradict the presence of other more distant young stars . \\n models of the cobe - dirbe infrared emission maps yield that the edge of the disk is at 4  kpc from the sun ( assuming @xmath38  kpc , * ? ? ? \\n denis star counts reveal the cut off of the stellar disk at a galactocentric distance of @xmath39  kpc . \\n in contrast , star counts from 2mass reveal no radial disk truncation at 14  kpc . \\n again , the depth of 2mass is not enough to reach large distances , which is possible with the vvv and ukidss - gps survey that reach 3 - 4 magnitudes fainter . \\n more recently , it was found that the 2mass star counts are best fit if the external disk is truncated at 12 - 14  kpc , while early a - type stars in the anticentre from the iphas survey reveal an exponential disk out to 13  kpc , with a steeper decline beyond that distance @xcite . \\n most of the previous evidence for cutoffs in the stellar distribution has been acquired at the anticentre fields . \\n the present deep exploration of different fields in three galactic quadrants finds consistent results . \\n even though we interpret this termination of the clump giant distribution as a truncation , we note that a break in the slope of the distribution would also be consistent with the data . \\n it is difficult to measure the sharpness of the cutoff , because the number of stars drop rapidly with distance , but as the surveys progress , we will have more fields in order to explore this issue . \\n this does not mean that one could not find other young stellar sources beyond the distance that we measure . \\n there are stars detected beyond the edge of the old stellar disk . \\n for example , there is a population of distant young stars at @xmath40  kpc , in two fields located in the third quadrant , slightly above the plane ( at @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) , based on @xmath43 photometry @xcite . \\n we see no evidence of a large population of clump giants at that distance in our fields . \\n @xmath8-band light traces mass in the disks of spiral galaxies @xcite , and the integrated @xmath8-band luminosity is dominated by red giants . \\n thus the clump giants are ideal tracers to define overall features and structural parameters of our milky way , like the edge of its disk . \\n the red clump giants trace the old and intermediate age populations , which are more uniformly distributed than young stars , following the mass of the galactic disk . however , thick disk and halo giants are expected to be located beyond the edge of the stellar thin disk , as have been detected by the segue project @xcite , contributing to the background that we see in all fields beyond a galactocentric distance of 13.9  kpc . \\n a similar result has been recently obtained independently by the glimpse team ( benjamin et al . \\n 2011 , in preparation ) .    finally , we are able to determine not only the extension but also the shape of the stellar disk of our galaxy for the first time . \\n asymmetric features such as lopsidedness are common in spiral galaxies @xcite . however , the results shown in fig .  [ map ] suggest that the stellar disk of the milky way is not significantly lopsided . \\n we acknowledge support by the fondap center for astrophysics , basal cata center for astrophysics and associated technologies , milenio milky way millennium nucleus from mideplan , fondecyt from conicyt , and the european southern observatory . \\n rs acknowledges financial support from conicyt through gemini project nr . \\n we gratefully acknowledge use of data from the vista telescope , and data products from the cambridge astronomical survey unit , and the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and ipac / caltech , funded by nasa and nsf .\",\n",

       " {'article': 'diamond - like material is expected to be abundant in the interstellar medium @xcite . \\n small nanodiamonds ( 2@xmath03 nm ) were extracted from meteoritic material , and they are the most abundant presolar grains in the primitive meteorites @xcite . recently , \\n diamondoid molecules were the subject of different experimental and theoretical studies revealing their spectroscopic properties @xcite . \\n these special hydrocarbons can be considered as faced - fused diamond cages where all carbon atoms are sp@xmath2 hybridized with hydrogens saturating the dangling bonds on the surface . \\n the diamond - like structure results in a remarkable rigidity , strength , and thermodynamic stability , especially compared to other hydrocarbons . \\n the smallest of these species , adamantane c@xmath3h@xmath4 , consists of only one diamond cage , followed by diamantane c@xmath5h@xmath6 with two , and triamantane c@xmath7h@xmath8 with three faced - fused cages . \\n diamondoids can be found in some natural gas reservoirs , and especially diamantane is one of the deposits in gas pipelines @xcite . \\n lately , diamondoids consisting of up to 11 diamond cages were isolated from petroleum by @xcite making these species accessible to laboratory investigations . \\n @xcite measured the infrared spectroscopic properties of powders of higher diamondoids ( up to hexamantane ) at room temperature . in accordance with calculations applying density functional theory ( dft ) , \\n the by far strongest features in the ir spectra of neutral diamondoids were found to be the c - h stretching bands between 3.4 and 3.6 @xmath9 m arising from the hydrogen - terminated surfaces . \\n @xcite additionally measured the ir emission spectra of hot ( 500 k ) gas phase adamantane , diamantane , and triamantane in the wavelength region of the c - h stretching modes revealing a small redshift of the bands in the solid - state spectra . based on the ir spectra obtained by @xcite along with additional dft calculations , @xcite also made assignments for two ir features of two different classes of astronomical objects . \\n the first one is the unusual ir emission at 3.43 and 3.53 @xmath9 m originating from two objects whose spectra are elsewhere dominated by the well - known infrared emission bands of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , elias 1 and the inner region of the circumstellar disk around hd 97048 @xcite . \\n although these bands were already assigned to nanodiamonds of at least 50 nm diameter @xcite , it was shown that also tetrahedral diamondoid molecules containing around 130 c atoms ( close to the size of the smallest meteoritic nanodiamonds ) exhibit the 3.43 and 3.53 @xmath9 m bands with the proper intensity ratio @xcite . \\n the second feature mentioned is the broad ( fwhm 0.09 @xmath9 m ) absorption band centered at 3.47 @xmath9 m which is observed in the absorption spectra of various dense clouds in lines of sight toward young stellar objects @xcite . \\n by co - adding all diamondoid solid - state spectra obtained by @xcite , @xcite showed that the different c - h stretching modes merge into a broad structure centered around 3.47 @xmath9 m , and they argued that small diamond - like molecules may therefore be a major contributor to the interstellar absorption band which is only observed in or behind dense molecular clouds , but not in the diffuse interstellar medium . as the intensity of the interstellar band \\n could be correlated with the intensity of the 3.08 @xmath9 m band of water ice , it was speculated that its carriers may be formed on icy grains in the shielded environment of molecular clouds @xcite which is furthermore supported by recent laboratory experiments where nanodiamond crystallites were created upon uv irradiation of interstellar ice analogs @xcite . \\n based on the computed intensities of the diamondoid c - h stretching bands , @xcite deduced that only 1@xmath03% of the cosmic c has to be locked in diamondoids in order to explain the observed intensity of the interstellar band . \\n furthermore , they calculated ionization potentials ( ips ) of neutral diamondoids , as well as ir spectra and electronic transition energies of neutral and cationic diamondoids , concluding that cations may also contribute to the 3.47 @xmath9 m absorption band . \\n however , the bands of the cations are somewhat weaker than those of their neutral counterparts . furthermore , the cations feature further bands with comparable strengths at longer wavelengths ( 6@xmath018 @xmath9 m ) , e.g. due to c - h bending vibrations , which could be used in the future to trace ionized diamondoids .    compared to the strong ir emission of pahs triggered by the absorption of uv - vis photons , the ir emission of neutral diamondoids is rather inefficient because their electronic absorption onset lies far in the uv between 6 and 7 ev @xcite . \\n calculations imply that diamondoid cations would feature absorption bands in the visible and near - ir due to their open - shell structure @xcite . \\n however , these transitions are very weak and , as for the neutrals , efficient ir emission can only be expected in regions of space experiencing high - energy and high - flux uv radiation fields , usually in close proximity of the exciting stars @xcite . therefore the 3.43 and 3.53 @xmath9 m emission features are so rarely observed , to date only in hd 97048 and elias 1 . \\n the ip of diamondoids ( 8@xmath09 ev ; * ? ? ? \\n * ) is only slightly higher than their band gap . \\n @xcite have shown that the photoion yield of diamondoids reaches its maximum between 10 and 11 ev , almost exactly around the hydrogen ly@xmath10 emission . \\n hence , ionization of neutral diamondoids in strongly irradiated regions of space ( hd 97048 and elias 1 ) may be very efficient . \\n consequently , one should address the following questions : are these cationic species stable and , if so , what are their spectroscopic fingerprints ? as already stated , one can expect weak absorption bands in the visible and near - uv wavelength range for the cations due to low - energy transitions to semi - occupied molecular orbitals , which might be detectable by electronic spectroscopy methods . unlike in pahs , there is no delocalized electron cloud . removing one electron due to photoionization weakens the bonds between the atoms , and fragmentation ( c@xmath0h bond breaking ) may occur . \\n indeed , such behavior was observed for the three smallest diamondoids . by comparing the ir absorption bands of \\n positively charged , gas phase adamantane @xcite , diamantane , and triamantane @xcite with theoretical spectra of dehydrogenated diamondoid cations , it was shown that these molecules easily lose a hydrogen atom upon ionization to form stable closed - shell species . \\n the loss preferentially happens on a tertiary carbon ( ch group ) rather than on a secondary carbon ( ch@xmath11 group ) . \\n since in these experiments , the ionization was performed via charge transfer using cationic agents with high ips , it is not obvious whether this dehydrogenation will also occur under astrophysical irradiation conditions .    in this work \\n , we investigated the electronic transitions of the four smallest diamondoids , namely adamantane c@xmath3h@xmath4 , diamantane c@xmath5h@xmath6 , triamantane c@xmath7h@xmath8 , and tetramantane c@xmath12h@xmath13 ( three isomers ) , and their photoproducts . for this purpose , we used matrix isolation spectroscopy ( mis ) . \\n cationic species were formed via uv irradiation using a hydrogen - flow discharge lamp to simulate the interstellar uv photon field . \\n our experimental findings are supported by theoretical calculations applying dft and time - dependent dft ( td - dft ) . \\n these results will help astronomers to search for the spectroscopic fingerprints of diamond - like molecular species . \\n furthermore , the uv absorption cross sections of neutral and cationic diamondoids can be used to accurately predict ir emission processes caused by stochastic heating due to the absorption of uv photons in strongly irradiated regions of space . \\n for the purpose of identification and comparison , we performed dft calculations for differently charged and de - hydrogenated diamondoids . \\n the molecular structures were first optimized with the gaussian09 software @xcite using the b3lyp functional @xcite in conjunction with the 6 - 311@xmath14g(2d , p ) basis set for adamantane and its derivatives , and the 6 - 311@xmath15g(d ) basis set for the larger diamondoids , respectively . \\n we chose the smaller basis set for the larger molecules to reduce the computational effort since no remarkable differences between 6 - 311@xmath14g(2d , p ) and 6 - 311@xmath15g(d ) were obtained for the ground - state structure and electronic spectrum of adamantane . \\n the vibrational modes were calculated afterward to check whether the optimized structures were really at their respective minima of the potential energy surfaces and to determine the zero - point corrections for the ground - state energies . \\n the dipole moments presented later have been corrected to correspond to the center - of - mass coordinate system . \\n the values obtained by the gaussian09 software refer to molecular orientations with the center of nuclear charge as origin . for the investigated species , \\n both values differ by less than 5% . \\n two different approaches were used to evaluate the energies of the excited electronic states . \\n the first one involves the td - dft implementation of gaussian09 , using the same functional and basis set as for the ground - state calculations . \\n the computational effort scales steeply with the size of the system under consideration and the number of excited states to be calculated . \\n this td - dft approach was used to accurately predict the first few electronic transitions of the diamondoids and their derivatives . \\n an error of about 0.3 ev regarding the energetic positions of the transitions can commonly be expected at this level of theory . \\n it should be mentioned that purely vertical electronic transitions are calculated . \\n vibrational excitations in excited electronic states can not be accounted for . \\n however , for higher energies the lifetimes of the excited states are expected to decrease substantially resulting in broad bands without discernible vibrational pattern even for cold gas phase molecules .    for the high - energy states , the td - dft formalism as implemented in the octopus software package @xcite was applied . \\n unlike the frequency - space implementation of td - dft in gaussian09 , octopus uses real - space numerical grids to propagate the kohn sham orbitals in real time . \\n followed by an initial very short electric pulse , exciting all frequencies of the system , the time - dependent dipole moment is calculated from which the linear optical absorption spectrum can be derived . \\n relying on numerical meshes , the code works without basis sets . \\n however , we used again the b3lyp functional . \\n the volume of the box in which the desired molecule is represented was chosen such that each atom was at least 4   away from the edges . \\n in all calculations , the grid spacing was 0.2  , the time integration length was 10 @xmath16 ev@xmath17 , and the time step was 0.002 @xmath16 ev@xmath17 . \\n this approach does not yield any information on the symmetry of the excited states . \\n the widths of the absorption bands are purely artificial and depend solely on the integration length used in the calculation . \\n however , the area of each band is directly related to the oscillator strength of the corresponding transition and can easily be converted into absorption cross section values . \\n optical spectra derived from the octopus code already gave reasonable agreement between calculated and measured absorption spectra and cross sections of pahs in the energy range above the ip ( 10@xmath030 ev ) where electronic transitions involving @xmath18 electrons dominate @xcite . \\n it should be stressed that only bound - bound transitions are predicted by this approach , whereas transitions leading to direct ionization can not be accounted for . \\n however , in view of the good agreement between experiment and theory for pahs , it was argued that superexcited states account for most of the absorption in the vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) and that they are coupled to the ionization continuum @xcite . whether the same situation also applies for the @xmath1 transitions of diamondoids and their ionic derivatives \\n can only be clarified when dedicated laboratory measurements are available .      to measure low - temperature spectra of the diamondoids and their photoproducts \\n , we used a setup for mis . a transparent caf@xmath11 window mounted inside of a vacuum chamber at the bottom of an expander \\n was cooled down to temperatures @xmath197 k. the molecules to be examined were condensed onto it together with an excess of inert gas . as matrix material we used neon ( linde , purity 99.995 % ) whose polarizability is low enough to keep the perturbation of the investigated molecules to a minimum . by turning the caf@xmath11 window by 90@xmath20 , \\n transmission spectroscopy down to 190 nm was performed with a spectrophotometer ( jasco v-670 ex ) , calibrated with an accuracy of 0.3 nm . \\n the chosen resolution was typically 0.5 nm , which is much smaller than the widths of the measured absorption bands . \\n prior to the incorporation of the diamondoids into the matrix , they were evaporated in an oven kept at suitable temperatures . due to the high vapor pressures of the smallest diamondoids , the oven had to be cooled down to temperatures as low as 0@xmath20c in the case of adamantane and diamantane . for adamantane , \\n a special polyvinylidene fluoride filter further decreased the gas flow to the caf@xmath11 window . \\n triamantane was heated up to 20@xmath20c @xmath0 30@xmath20c and the tetramantanes to 90@xmath20c . \\n the deposition rates of the neutral diamondoid precursors and the matrix material , both transparent in the investigated wavelength range , were determined in separate experiments by deposition of the pure substance on the low - temperature window and measuring the transmission of the as - prepared films with the spectrometer . a typical interference pattern corresponding to the transmission of an etalon could be observed for sufficiently thin films from which the thicknesses and , therefore , the column densities could be derived ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) . \\n after preparation of the transparent matrix doped with the neutral precursor molecules , an absorption spectrum , usually displaying no discrete features , was measured and used as a new baseline . \\n the samples were then photolyzed with the far - uv emission from a microwave - driven hydrogen - flow discharge lamp @xcite . \\n the spectra recorded afterward feature absorption bands from species created during the irradiation . for comparison , we also irradiated a clean ne matrix and films of pure diamondoids which were deposited on the 7 k cold caf@xmath11 window without simultaneous ne flow . \\n besides trace amounts of dissociated water in the case of the inert gas , we did not observe any features . \\n this confirms that the measured bands are indeed due to photoproducts of isolated diamondoids . \\n the hydrogen lamp itself was operated with a gas mixture of 10% h@xmath11 and 90% ar , usually at a pressure of 0.6 mbar . \\n the purpose of the inert gas is to suppress the 160 nm molecular emission and enhance the 121.6 nm ( 10.2 ev ) ly@xmath10 emission , but it also introduces additional lines from the ar at 106.7 nm ( 11.6 ev ) and 104.8 nm ( 11.8 ev ) . \\n the lamp was separated from the vacuum of the mis chamber by a lif window . \\n its total photon flux of @xmath21 photons s@xmath17 was determined by measuring the photocurrent emanating from a pt plate under fuv light exposure . during the experiments , \\n the intensity on the sample surface was typically @xmath22 photons m@xmath23 s@xmath17 . \\n usually , the irradiation was performed for 15@xmath030 minutes . \\n in figure [ fig2 ] , the structure and calculated ground - state energy of adamantane , as well as the energies of the adamantane and adamantyl cations are displayed . \\n adamantane possesses two structurally different h sites and therefore two different adamantyl isomers . \\n the numbers on the adamantane structure shown in figure [ fig2 ] indicate the c atoms from which the h atoms are removed to form the corresponding adamantyl structures . according to the calculations , only minor distortions of the carbon framework \\n are expected upon h removal . \\n this also applies to the larger species we have investigated . for the ground states of the adamantyl cations , different spin states are principally possible . \\n however , the triplet state of the 1-adamantyl cation is about 3 ev higher in energy than the singlet state . because of this rather high energy difference \\n , we expect all other dehydrogenated diamondoid cations to be closed - shell singlet species as well and the calculations were performed accordingly . for completeness \\n , we also calculated the structures and ground - state energies of the neutral 1- and 2-adamantyl radicals . in both cases , \\n an energy of 4.2 ev would be necessary to remove one h atom . however , direct photodissociation is unlikely since the absorption onset is further in the uv . \\n basically , the photons delivered by the hydrogen lamp provide enough energy to cause photoionization , as well as the removal of one h atom from the ionized molecule . \\n further dissociation can not be accomplished with a single photon . \\n considering the low fuv doses applied during the experiments , comprising typically 15@xmath030 minutes of irradiation , further processing of already ionized molecules can be excluded . \\n this was ensured by increasing the irradiation time up to 2 hr without noticeable change of the absorption bands . \\n the calculated spectra of neutral and cationic adamantane and adamantyl , using the b3lyp/6@xmath0311@xmath14g(2d , p ) level of theory , are displayed in the upper two panels of figure [ fig3 ] . \\n the theoretical spectra were obtained by convolving the shown stick spectra , representing the oscillator strength of each transition at its corresponding transition wavelength , with lorentzian functions . \\n while the area of each lorentzian is proportional to the calculated oscillator strength , the width was chosen to be constant ( 3000 cm@xmath17 ) . \\n the chosen bandwidth is rather arbitrary , but the so - computed spectrum indicates in which energy range strong electronic transitions of the real molecule can be expected \\n .    the measured spectrum of fuv - processed adamantane in solid ne ( 6.8 k ) can be found in the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] . \\n the ratio of ne to adamantane in terms of absolute numbers of atoms or molecules was determined as described in section [ misfuv ] . \\n the densities of solid ne and adamantane were taken to be 45 atoms nm@xmath25 @xcite and 1.2 g cm@xmath25 @xcite , respectively . \\n using these values , the isolation ratio ( ne to adamantane ) was estimated to be better than 190 @xmath27 @xmath28 . \\n the factor @xmath27 @xmath28 is the ratio of the refractive indices of the pure solid materials in the visible and should be between 1 and 2 . \\n nevertheless , we also performed measurements at lower isolation ratios and did not notice appreciable spectral differences . \\n since it is unknown what fraction of the neutral precursor molecules is actually transformed into cations we can not provide experimental values for the absorption cross section . \\n as indicated in figure [ fig3 ] , an additional baseline correction was applied to remove the strong scattering background in the uv . \\n because of its wavelength dependence ( @xmath29 ) , we attribute this background mainly to an increased rayleigh scattering of the charged species compared to their neutral counterparts . \\n the derived absorption spectrum consists of four broad features above 200 nm . the broad band between 280 and 350 nm with maximum around 308 nm is not an artifact of the measurement . \\n it has been confirmed by repeatedly performed experiments . \\n the same applies to the two somewhat narrower features at 252 and 261 nm . \\n the strongest band in the accessible wavelength region extends from 200 to 240 nm and peaks at 223.5 nm . considering the theoretical results \\n , we exclude the presence of open - shell adamantane cations in the photo - processed matrix due to the absence of bands in the visible . instead , the observed spectrum points toward the creation of the more stable , closed - shell , singly de - hydrogenated cation . \\n therefore , we assign the strongest band at 223.5 nm to the s@xmath30 s@xmath11 transition of the 1-adamantyl cation ( point group c@xmath31 ) which is the isomer with lower ground - state energy . \\n the calculated oscillator strength of this band is @xmath32 . \\n its position is 0.3 ev away from the measured value in ne matrix which is a reasonable error for the applied theoretical model . \\n the other weaker transitions may be related to the s@xmath30 s@xmath33 transition of the 1-adamantyl cation ( @xmath34 ) and , more likely , to the first four excited states of the 2-adamantyl cation ( point group c@xmath35 ) with calculated oscillator strengths below @xmath36 . \\n a more reliable assignment on the basis of computed spectra would be possible via ir spectroscopic investigations , because ir - active vibrations can be more easily and accurately calculated using quantum chemical models . \\n however , this is beyond the scope of the present investigation \\n . nevertheless , taking into account the weaker band strengths of the 2-adamantyl cation and comparing the calculated with the measured spectra , it seems that the second isomer is almost as abundantly created as the 1-adamantyl cation . \\n the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] contains a sum spectrum of both isomers ( each contributing 50 % ) . besides the 0.3 ev redshift of the 1-adamantyl band , it closely resembles the measured spectrum . to some extent , this would be in contradiction to the results obtained by @xcite who used an indirect charge transfer method to create the ions and subsequently observed only the isomer with the lowest ground - state energy . \\n a possible explanation may be found in the different experimental techniques ( charge transfer versus photoionization ) and conditions ( gas phase versus matrix at low temperature ) that were applied . \\n considering the previous results , the adamantane molecules were subjected to dissociative photoionization upon irradiation with fuv photons of energy 10.2 @xmath0 11.8 ev according to @xmath37 this process has been described for a few smaller molecules , e.g. , h@xmath11o @xcite or ch@xmath38 @xcite . \\n after ionization , some excess energy is stored in the vibrational degrees of freedom of the cationic molecule which subsequently leads to the destruction of one terminal c@xmath0h bond . during this process , \\n electrons and neutral h atoms are released which are usually trapped on defects or impurities in the matrix . \\n because of recombination reactions between positively charged molecules and released electrons ( and h atoms ) , the ion yield saturates when a certain irradiation dose is reached . \\n the formation of negatively charged adamantane or neutral adamantyl molecules due to electron attachment can be ruled out for the following reasons . \\n first , these species possess an open - shell electronic structure and , like the adamantane cation , would feature absorption bands in the visible part of the spectrum . and \\n second , as far as neutral adamantane is concerned , the negative electron affinity @xcite hampers further electron attachment .    notably , we observed neither sharp absorption bands nor a clear vibrational pattern . \\n we want to remark that the measured bands are much broader than what is expected for typical matrix - induced broadening ( at least for 7 k neon matrices ) which is mainly due to site effects . \\n we tentatively attribute this to an intrinsic property of the molecule , i.e. , a very short lifetime of the excited state which is not entirely caused by the interaction with the rare gas atoms . \\n this would lead to the conclusion that the main difference to astrophysically more relevant spectra of cold gas phase adamantyl cations is a small matrix - induced redshift , but not a broadening of the absorption bands . by coincidence , \\n the spectral shape is in surprisingly good agreement with the computed spectra of the purely electronic ( vertical ) transitions . \\n therefore , the absolute values of the absorption cross sections , as they appear in the calculated spectra , may be regarded as representative for real gas phase molecules . \\n finally , we want to highlight another important property of the adamantyl cations . unlike their neutral precursor adamantane \\n , these species possess rather strong permanent dipole moments pointing from the molecular center toward the c atom from which the h atom has been removed . \\n the calculated dipole moments of the 1- and 2-adamantyl cations amount to 0.96 and 2.57 debye , even stronger than the dipole moment of the open - shell cation ( 0.61 debye ) . \\n this opens the possibility to detect and identify molecular diamond - like species in space using their rotational spectra . \\n the calculated ground - state energies of diamantane and its singly dehydrogenated cationic derivatives are displayed in figure [ fig4 ] . \\n again , the numbers on the diamantane structure shown indicate the positions from where the hydrogen atoms are removed to form the corresponding closed - shell cations \\n . there are three possible isomers for the diamantyl cation , possessing quite strong permanent dipole moments of 1.76 ( d1 ) , 3.09 ( d4 ) , and 3.71 debye ( d3 ) due to the localized charge at the edge of the molecule . \\n the electronic spectra of diamantane and its related species are presented in figure [ fig5 ] . \\n an additional background correction has been applied on the red side of the measured spectrum to remove non - reproducible bumps and fringes due to baseline variations . using 1.2 g cm@xmath25 @xcite as mass density of the solid diamantane deposit , the isolation ratio ( ne to diamantane ) varied in different experiments between 450 @xmath39 @xmath28 and 750 @xmath39 @xmath28 , where @xmath39 is the refractive index of the diamantane film . \\n compared to the photoprocessed adamantane , the spectrum of irradiated diamantane reveals a slightly broader peak ( 7800 cm@xmath17 versus 5900 cm@xmath17 ) , positioned further to the red at 255 nm . \\n as is evident upon inspection of the calculated and measured spectra , this feature can not be explained by the presence of open - shell cation radicals . \\n regarding the formation of negatively charged diamantane or neutral diamantyl radicals , the same reasoning applies as in section [ adam_section ] . \\n principally , the photons from the hydrogen lamp carry enough energy to induce dissociative photoionization and create all three diamantyl isomers . \\n however , the conclusion may be drawn that the main photoproduct in the matrix experiment is the 4-diamantyl cation ( point group c@xmath40 ) . \\n its first strong transitions s@xmath30 s@xmath41 are predicted at 284 nm ( @xmath42 ) and 269 nm ( @xmath43 ) , 0.5 and 0.26 ev away from the peak maximum of the measured band at 255 nm . \\n alternatively , the 255 nm band may partly or completely originate from transitions caused by the 1-diamantyl cation ( c@xmath44 ) for which several close - lying absorptions at 289 nm ( s@xmath30 s@xmath45 , @xmath46 ) , 271 nm(s@xmath30 s@xmath38 , @xmath47 ) , and 266 nm ( s@xmath30 s@xmath48 , @xmath49 ) are predicted . due to the lack of certain absorption features in the measured spectrum \\n , the presence of the 3-diamantyl isomer ( c@xmath33 ) in the matrix , i.e. the h removal from a ch@xmath11 group , can rather be excluded . \\n because of the apparent absence of fine structure , it seems difficult to draw further conclusions . \\n figure [ fig6 ] displays the calculated ground - state energies of triamantane and its seven isomers of singly dehydrogenated cations . \\n the necessary energies to remove one electron and one h atom from the parent molecule are comparable to the previously discussed diamondoids . basically , the fuv lamp delivers photons with energies high enough to create all seven isomers . \\n their dipole moments , again quite strong , range between 1.13 and 5.72 debye . \\n the dipole moment of the open - shell cation amounts to 0.51 debye . \\n the corresponding calculated electronic spectra , as well as the measured spectrum of fuv - irradiated triamantane in ne are displayed in figure [ fig7 ] . \\n the isolation ratio in the matrix experiment was on the order of 500 @xmath0 1000 @xmath50 @xmath28 with unknown refractive index of the pure triamantane ( @xmath50 ) film . \\n the photodissociation of trace amounts of water in the matrix is responsible for the narrow bands from the oh radical at 308 and 283 nm @xcite . \\n compared to the previous measurements of irradiated adamantane and diamantane , the lowest - energy spectral feature shifts further to the red , extending roughly from 300 to 500 nm . \\n it peaks at 368 nm and has a shoulder around 450 nm . \\n a strong fuv rise also slides into the accessible wavelength region . \\n an assignment to a certain isomer of the triamantyl cation is rather difficult . \\n oddly , the best match seems to be possible with the calculated spectrum of the 5-triamantyl cation which is 10.56 ev higher in energy than the triamantane neutral . \\n ( in the previously discussed measurements , the strongest bands seemed to be caused by species which were 10.35 ev ( adamantane ) and 10.27 ev ( diamantane ) away from the parent molecule . ) besides dehydrogenated triamantyl cations , an alternative explanation for the measured broad band would be the formation of the open - shell triamantane cation as can be seen from the comparison with the corresponding calculated spectrum . \\n possibly , triamantane is already big enough , and the energy stored in the molecule upon absorption of an fuv photon is distributed over sufficient vibrational modes to avoid h abstraction . \\n nevertheless , a clear identification of the created species on the basis of electronic absorption spectroscopy is not possible and one should take into account the possibility that the applied quantum chemical model deviates more strongly from reality than expected . \\n in contrast to the smaller diamondoids , there are already three different isomers of neutral tetramantane c@xmath12h@xmath13 , while one of them has actually two enantiomers ( p and m [ 123]-tetramantane ) . \\n their structures , the calculated spectra of their cations , as well as the measured spectra of their photoproducts , are displayed in figure [ fig8 ] . \\n we did not calculate the structures and spectra of the tetramantyl cations because of the increasing number of isomers and therefore escalating computational effort . regarding the necessary energies for h abstraction \\n , we do not expect large deviations from the smaller diamondoids . with almost no difference among the three species , \\n the measured spectra are very similar to what has been measured for triamantane . \\n besides [ 121]-tetramantane , the broad feature extending roughly from 300 to 500 nm could be assigned to the open - shell cations as is obvious upon comparison with the calculations . \\n the [ 121]-tetramantane cation , however , should have stronger bands at longer wavelengths suggesting that the measured spectrum is actually caused by the corresponding singly dehydrogenated cation . \\n whether the other two tetramantanes ( [ 123 ] and [ 1(2)3 ] ) lost a peripheral h atom upon ionization or not , can not completely be clarified , as there are too many tetramantyl isomers and , as is the case with triamantane , a comparison with td - dft theory would not provide unambiguous insights . \\n the electronic spectra of the neutral and cationic diamondoids resulting from ( all possible ) bound - bound ( @xmath1 ) transitions , as calculated with the octopus code , are displayed in figure [ fig9 ] . \\n these spectra may be used to model photophysical interactions of diamond - like molecules in the interstellar medium . for a brief discussion about their physical relevance \\n refer to section [ theory ] . regarding the energy range below 8.5 ev , more detailed , measured gas phase absorption spectra of neutral diamondoids \\n can be found in the publication of @xcite . \\n the vibrational structure that can be seen in these spectra can hardly be predicted with current theoretical methods . \\n the spectra presented here feature broader bands that are purely artificial . \\n an additional energy - dependent broadening by convolving the spectra with lorentzians of increasing bandwidths has been applied to account for an increased lifetime broadening which is expected at higher energies . due to the high density of states above @xmath51 10 ev , changing the bandwidths does not substantially alter the absolute cross section values . \\n while the positions and shapes of resonances appearing in the spectra may be affected by uncertainties of the computational method the general trend of the absorption curves and the cross section values may be regarded as real ( at least within the limitations discussed before ) . \\n comparing the spectra of the neutral and ionized molecules with each other , it is obvious that there are not many differences , especially for the transitions at higher energies , as the electronic structure of the c skeleton is equivalent . \\n for all species , the high - energy absorption is dominated by a broad hump with a maximum between 15 and 20 ev . also other features on the red and blue tails of this @xmath1 hump , like peaks at 11 , 14 , and 28.5 ev for the cations or 9 , 12.5 , and 27.5 ev for the neutrals \\n are very much comparable . \\n as already discussed in the previous sections , the absorption onset of the cations appears further to the red compared to their neutral precursors which is also evident from figure [ fig9 ] . by increasing the molecular size , \\n two effects are obvious : rising values for the absolute absorption cross section and a trend toward a less - structured absorption curve due to an increased density of states . \\n we want to point out an interesting aspect of these results . \\n even though laboratory experiments in the discussed energy range for these molecular species are lacking , experimental data on nanodiamonds , extracted and isolated from the allende meteorite @xcite , display surprising resemblances ( see figure [ fig9 ] ) . these nanodiamonds possess an average size of less than 2 nm , corresponding to @xmath52 500 c atoms , which is much bigger than the molecular diamonds presented here , the largest of which contains 22 c atoms . \\n their electronic absorption spectra solely consist of the broad @xmath1 band with maximum at 17.1 ev . \\n furthermore , a shoulder can be seen around 30 ev which may have its equivalent in a band at 28.5 ev in the diamondoid spectra . \\n the peak mass absorption coefficient @xmath53 for the meteoritic nanodiamonds was found to be @xmath54 , very close to the calculated values of @xmath55 for the molecular diamond . \\n the main differences of the molecular compared to the nanoscopic material are the redshifted absorption onset and a more structured absorption curve , especially on the red wing of the collective @xmath1 hump . \\n we have investigated the electronic absorption properties of the smallest diamondoids , a possible molecular part of the interstellar carbonaceous dust with diamond - like structure . for adamantane and diamantane , \\n our results confirm the formation of closed - shell singly dehydrogenated cations upon fuv irradiation which , similarly , was already found in previous studies by @xcite and @xcite in the infrared regime using an indirect ionization method . \\n further ionization of the adamantyl and diamantyl cations , even in strongly irradiated regions of space , may be hampered by the rather large second ip . \\n for instance , dft calculations ( b3lyp / 6 - 311++g(2d , p ) ) imply a 14.1 ev energy difference between the cation and dication of 1-adamantyl . \\n a clear identification of the created isomers in the matrix experiments , i.e. , information about which h atom was removed from the edge of the molecule , through comparison with td - dft calculations is rather uncertain . starting with triamantane \\n , our results leave open the possibility that larger diamondoids are just ionized upon fuv irradiation , and that the absorbed photon energy is distributed over sufficient vibrational degrees of freedom to avoid h abstraction . \\n further spectroscopic investigations of fuv - processed diamondoids in the ir range would help to clarify this issue as molecular vibrations can be more accurately predicted by current theoretical models .    in our experiments , \\n the dissociation of adamantane and diamantane was initiated via photoionization . \\n besides recombination reactions due to the close proximity of the molecules in the matrix , we do not expect that the interaction with the matrix atoms has a strong influence on the dissociation process itself and suggest that , if present as gas phase molecules , small diamondoids in interstellar space are subjected to h abstraction upon fuv irradiation . \\n the measured spectra of the created ions isolated in solid ne matrices display broad bands in the uv , shifting to longer wavelengths with increasing molecular size . \\n the widths of these bands were found to be much larger than expected from typical broadening effects caused by the interaction with the rare gas atoms of the matrix . \\n therefore , we attribute this to an intrinsic effect of the molecules , i.e. , a very short lifetime of the excited state which is not entirely caused by the interaction with the ne matrix . \\n this implies that , besides a small matrix - induced redshift , uv spectra of cationic diamondoids in the gas phase would feature bands similar in shape and width as in the matrix spectra . \\n unfortunately , the lack of narrow bands also hampers a possible detection in space via uv observations . the photoprocessed adamantane displays a broad absorption band at 223.5 nm which may be found at slightly shorter wavelengths in the gas phase . \\n however , a possible contribution to the interstellar 217.5 nm uv bump can be rather excluded due to its weakness ( @xmath56 ) and several further absorption bands in close proximity at shorter wavelengths which are incompatible with the interstellar extinction curve . however , the specific structures of the dehydrogenated cations open other possibilities for detection . unlike their neutral precursor molecules , \\n such species possess strong permanent dipole moments due to the missing h atom and localized charge at the molecular periphery , permitting an identification by means of rotational spectroscopy . \\n potential targets for radio - based observations could be ( the edges of ) dense molecular clouds where small diamondoids can be expected , if the assignment of the 3.47 @xmath9 m absorption band is valid , or the close proximity of objects with intense uv radiation fields , such as hd 97048 and elias 1 , where the 3.43 and 3.53 @xmath9 m emission features were observed . \\n the main uv absorption feature at higher energies ( @xmath5710 ev ) of diamond - like material is the collective @xmath1 peak . \\n also the diamondoids and their cationic derivatives exhibit this feature and , interestingly , its position ( 18 ev ) and cross section ( max . \\n @xmath58 ) are very similar to the extinction hump measured for the much larger meteoritic nanodiamonds @xcite . \\n however , the molecular material additionally displays certain narrow features on the red tail of the @xmath1 hump ( see also * ? ? ? \\n these results may prove useful for the modeling of diamondoid ir emission caused by stochastic heating from uv photons and , thus , they can contribute to the discussion about the origin of the ir emission features of hd 97048 and elias 1 . \\n + this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) and ( in part ) by the department of energy , office of basic energy sciences , division of materials sciences and engineering , under contract de -

    "in [ 18 ] tierney and vogel for any functor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a category with finite limits and with a projective class @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is an abelian category , have constructed derived functors and investigated relationships of their theory with other theories of derived functors . \n",
    " namely , they have shown that if @xmath1 is abelian and @xmath4 is additive , then their theory coincides with the classical relative theory of eilenberg - moore [ 7 ] , whereas if @xmath1 is abelian and @xmath4 is an arbitrary functor , then it gives a generalization of the theory of dold - puppe [ 6 ] . besides , they showed that their derived functors are naturally isomorphic to the cotriple derived functors of barr - beck [ 3 ] if there is a cotriple in @xmath1 that realizes the given projective class @xmath2 . \n",
    " the key point in the construction of the derived functors by tierney and vogel is that , using @xmath2-projective objects and simplicial kernels , for every @xmath5 from @xmath1 a @xmath2-projective resolution can be constructed , which is an @xmath5-augmented pseudosimplicial object in @xmath1 and which for a given @xmath5 is unique up to a presimplicial homotopy ( according to the comparison theorem for @xmath2-projective resolutions ) . \n",
    " a natural question arises about constructing a cubical analog of the theory of tierney and vogel . \n",
    " exactly this is the purpose of this paper .    before turning to the content of the paper itself , \n",
    " let us say few words about cubical objects and techniques . \n",
    " as it is well known , simplicial methods are developed for long time and are successfully used in algebra and topology . with less success , but still also cubical techniques have been developed , which was initiated on one hand by the systematic use of singular cubes in the singular homology theory of topological spaces ( see , for example , [ 14 ] ) , and , on the other hand , by the papers of kan [ 12 , 13 ] which have related cubical sets to homotopy theory . \n",
    " further research ( see e.  g. [ 1,2,4,5,8 - 11,16,17,19 ] ) has also shown that the cubical approach is interesting and important . \n",
    " cubical objects have a number of advantages compared to the simplicial ones . \n",
    " for example , a ( pre)cubical homotopy is given by a single morphism in each dimension , whereas a ( pre)simplicial homotopy requires `` many '' morphisms . on the other hand , \n",
    " significant disadvantages of the cubical technique with respect to the simplicial one are also apparent . \n",
    " for example , a cubical group , in fact even a cubical abelian group , can fail to satisfy the kan condition [ 16,17 ] . in the context of elimination of these and other disadvantages of the cubical theory , of extreme importance \n",
    " are cubical objects with connections introduced by brown and higgins [ 4 ] . \n",
    " these objects are cubical objects with extra degeneracies , called connections . \n",
    " to stress importance and naturality of cubical objects with connections it suffices to name e.  g. the following three facts . \n",
    " the singular cubical complex of any topological space has naturally defined connections . \n",
    " next , tonks in [ 19 ] has shown that any cubical group with connections satisfies the kan condition . \n",
    " finally , brown and higgins [ 5 ] have recently proved that the category of cubical objects with connections in an abelian category is equivalent to the category of nonnegative chain complexes in the same category .    in this paper \n",
    " we introduce pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections , obtained from the brown - higgins structure of a cubical object with connections by suitably relaxing their identities . \n",
    " projective precubical resolutions which we are using to construct cubical derived functors possess pseudodegeneracies and pseudoconnections and this fact is essentially used in the construction of derived functors defined by us . \n",
    " now let us list the contents of the paper by sections . \n",
    " in section [ prelim ] we recall the notions of presimplicial , pseudosimplicial and simplicial objects , precubical , cubical objects and cubical objects with connections , their morphisms , and the respective augmented versions of these notions . \n",
    " we also recall the definitions of normalization functors in the simplicial setting by moore , and in the cubical setting by wiatek [ 16 ] . \n",
    " furthermore we recall the kan cubical sets and their homotopy groups .    for any presimplicial object @xmath6 in an abelian category @xmath1 the normalized chain complex of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath7 in this paper , is a chain subcomplex of the unnormalized chain complex of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath8 . \n",
    " the well known moore theorem says that if @xmath6 is a simplicial object in @xmath1 , then this inclusion is a chain homotopy equivalence ( in fact this is valid for any pseudosimplicial object in @xmath1 ) . on the other hand , for any precubical object @xmath9 in an abelian category @xmath1 , one has the canonical inclusion @xmath10 of chain complexes @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath1 which are cubical analogs of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see [ 16 , 17 ] ) respectively , and which functorially depend on @xmath9 . in section 2 \n",
    " we introduce pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections and prove that @xmath13 is a chain homotopy equivalence for any pseudocubical object @xmath9 with pseudoconnections ( in particular for any cubical object @xmath9 with connections ) . \n",
    " thus we obtain a cubical analog of the moore theorem . \n",
    " then we establish some results which are not needed later on ; however they seem interesting by themselves . \n",
    " let us mention some of them . \n",
    " we indicate an alternative proof of the aforementioned brown - higgins equivalence . furthermore , we point out that this equivalence is realized by the above functor @xmath14 . \n",
    " next , we show that if @xmath15 is a kan cubical group , then @xmath16 , the @xmath17-th homotopy group of @xmath15 , coincides with @xmath18 , the @xmath17-th homology group of @xmath19 ( note that @xmath19 and @xmath18 are defined for any cubical group @xmath15 as well ) . using this and the cubical analog of the moore theorem together with the aforementioned result of tonks \n",
    " , we get that @xmath16 is naturally isomorphic to @xmath20 for any cubical abelian group @xmath15 with connections . \n",
    " let @xmath1 be a category with finite limits and a projective class @xmath2 , @xmath3 an abelian category , and @xmath0 an arbitrary ( covariant ) finctor . in section 3 \n",

    " . then we prove the comparison theorem which in particular says that @xmath24 is unique up to precubical homotopy for a given @xmath5 . \n",
    " furthermore , it is shown that any @xmath2-projective precubical resolution @xmath24 is in fact an augmented pseudocubical object with pseudoconnections . \n",
    " we define @xmath25 , @xmath23 , to be the @xmath17-th homology of @xmath26 . \n",
    " besides the comparison theorem , the fact that @xmath27 has pseudodegeneracies is crucial in proving that @xmath25 are well - defined and functorially depend on @xmath5 . \n",
    " this contrasts with the construction of the derived functors by tierney and vogel which does not use existence of pseudodegeneracies in @xmath2-projective presimplicial resolutions ( pseudodegeneracies of @xmath2-projective presimplicial resolutions are essentially used when the theory of tierney and vogel is compared with other theories of derived functors ) . \n",
    " further , we define @xmath28 , @xmath23 , to be the @xmath17-th homology group of @xmath29 . \n",
    " now this construction essentially uses the fact that @xmath27 is a pseudocubical object with pseudoconnections , i.  e. , this is crucial for proving that @xmath30 are well - defined and functorial in @xmath5 . \n",
    " the cubical analog of the moore theorem proved in the previous section shows that in fact there are isomorphisms @xmath31 , @xmath23 , which are natural in @xmath5 and @xmath4 . \n",

       "[{'article': 'the property of many - body quantum systems to be in entangled , or inseparable , states is the object of significant constant interest @xcite . \\n entanglement is the essentially quantum feature signifying the formation of new entities , the complexes of particles . if one would try to separate an individual particle from such complex by performing a measurement one would inevitably affect the states of other particles in the complex even if the direct interaction is absent .    because of their highly unusual , from the classical point of view , properties the entangled states attract attention from both purely scientific and application points of view . as a result , as a problem of special importance there is the problem of producing entangled states . \\n for example , nowadays the most developed and widely used method of generating the entangled photons is the parametric down conversion @xcite , which is based on the two - photon radiative decay of excited states . \\n this method , however , suffers from intrinsic limitations  very low yield and rescaling the wavelength of the emitted photons @xcite . \\n therefore , there is the constant search of alternative sources of entangled light , which motivates thorough investigating of the physics of entangling . \\n the analysis of entangling photons requires different approach comparing to that of canonical quantum mechanical systems , say , qubits . \\n first , one has to take into account indistinguishability of the photons , which imposes the severe restrictions on available set of states . \\n second , the interaction of the quantized electromagnetic field with medium excitations is accompanied by the processes of absorption and re - emission , hence the description should naturally incorporate the fact that the number of particles is not a constant . \\n these circumstances suggest that the most suitable framework for description of the photon entanglement is provided by the quantum field theory . within this framework \\n the entanglement is characterized using the single - particle density matrix ( spdm ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 enumerate the modes of the field . \\n for example , for the situation considered in the present paper @xmath4 and @xmath5 run over  @xmath1 \" and  @xmath2 \" polarizations .    throughout the paper \\n we incorporate the time dependence into the heisenber representation of the field operators @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the hamiltonian of the system , therefore , the average in formulas similar to ( [ eq : sdm_def ] ) is taken with respect to the initial state @xmath8 . \\n we assume that initially the system is in a pure state and that the decohering processes are absent , therefore entanglement manifests itself in mixed single - particle states , that is the spdm has rank ( or the schmidt number ) larger than one @xcite . \\n more specifically the entanglement can be quantified by the von neumann entropy of the spdm @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the normalized eigenvalues of the spdm , so that @xmath11 .    in the present paper \\n we study the time dependence of entanglement of initially disentangled few - photon states in the two - mode jaynes - cummings model . \\n this model closely corresponds to the dynamics of entanglement of the photons in the initially pumped cavity with a single atom admitting transitions with different helicities . \\n the absorption and re - emission of photons with different polarizations is assumed to be completely independent . from the canonical point of view \\n this may seem to be similar to a many - body system without interaction , where entanglement is an integral of motion , that is initially disentangled states remain disentangled . \\n however , as we will show , due to the complex character of the photons states the interaction with the atom leads to entangling states with different polarizations with non - trivial time dependence of @xmath0 . \\n the most convenient framework for the description of the photon entanglement is provided by schwinger s model of angular momentum @xcite . \\n the components of the operator of angular momentum are defined in terms of the photons creation and annihilation operators as @xmath12 using these operators one can characterize the photons states by the total angular momentum @xmath13 and its projection @xmath14 instead of the population numbers , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , of the states with  @xmath1\"- and  @xmath2\"-polarizations . \\n so , one has @xmath17 with the relations @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    expressing the spdm in terms of the mean values of the operator of the angular momentum \\n one finds that the normalized eigenvalues of the spdm can be expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 $ ] being the total number of the photons . \\n thus , the entanglement can be written as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 \\\\log_2\\\\left[1 + ( -1)^n x \\\\right].\\\\ ] ] in particular , disentangled states are the states with the maximum magnitude of the average angular momentum @xmath24 and completely entangled ones are those with @xmath25 . \\n it is interesting to compare this representation with the description of entanglement in the canonical quantum mechanical setup . \\n considering the two - photon case , @xmath26 , one can find that the total value of the angular momentum is directly related to the concurrence @xcite @xmath27 .    such description of entanglement allows a simple parametrization of disentangled states . \\n this is especially convenient for the problem with initially disentangled photons , which naturally appears when one considers the free dynamics of initially pumped cavity with an atom . \\n the parametrization is based on the facts that for the disentangled states and the disentangled states only one has @xmath28 and that the average angular momentum @xmath29 transforms under rotations as a three - dimensional vector . \\n hence , any disentangled state can be turned by the rotations into @xmath30 , or , in other words , any disentangled state can be presented as @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the euler angles . for the case of our main interest in the present paper \\n only rotations by angle @xmath33 produce the states with different dynamics of entanglement , therefore , in the following consideration we limit our attention to @xmath34 . \\n the dynamics of the two - mode jaynes - cummings model @xcite is governed by the hamiltonian , which we write down in terms of the creation and annihilation operators @xmath35 here the first two terms describe the dynamics of the free field and the free atom , respectively . here \\n @xmath4 runs over the photon polarizations , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and @xmath36 takes the values from the set of the electron states @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 stand for the ground and excited atom levels and @xmath40 , @xmath41 are the electron spins . \\n the interaction between the atom and photons preserves the helicity , that is the excitation of the electron state with the spin down at the ground level , @xmath42 , into the spin up state at the excited level @xmath43 occurs through the absorption of \\n @xmath1\"-polarized photon and so on . \\n the interaction is described by the hamiltonians @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the respective rabi frequencies . \\n the interplay between different characteristic frequencies determining the dynamics of the system leads to the complex time dependence of the amplitudes . in order to concentrate on the main features , we adopt the resonant approximation and set @xmath48 . \\n additionally we assume that the symmetry between transitions with different helicities is not broken so that @xmath49 .    in order to describe the time dependence of entanglement we use the explicit form of the heisenberg representation for the photon operators @xmath50 . \\n taking into account the separability of the dynamics we have @xcite @xmath51 a_k - \\\\rmi \\\\frac { \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\bar{{\\\\mathcal{c}}}_k t\\\\right)}{\\\\bar{{\\\\mathcal{c}}}_k } \\\\sigma_k    \\\\right\\\\},\\\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 . \\n taking into account that initially the atom is not excited the initial state of the system is presented as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the disentangled photon state obtained by rotations from the state @xmath30 [ see ( [ eq : disent_inter ] ) ] and @xmath56 denotes the state of the atom with both electrons at the ground level . \\n it should be noted with this regard that the second term in ( [ eq : ev_op ] ) does not contribute to @xmath57 because it vanishes while acting on the initial state of the atom . \\n first , we consider @xmath58 . \\n taking into account the identity @xmath59 we find @xmath60 \\\\right\\\\rangle}.\\\\ ] ] here and below the average is taken over the initial photon state @xmath61 . \\n the second term in ( [ eq : jc_jz ] ) has the maximum magnitude in completely polarized case , that is when @xmath62 , when it has the form of oscillations with the frequency @xmath63 due to absorption and re - emission of the single photon by the atom signifying the entanglement of photons and atomic states . \\n the magnitude of this term monotonously decreases with @xmath64 and vanishes identically in the unpolarized case , when @xmath65 . \\n it should be noted that even in the polarized case the relative contribution of the last term in ( [ eq : jc_jz ] ) is relatively small @xmath66 and thus one can consider @xmath67 as imposing the limitation from above on the maximum value of achievable entanglement . \\n therefore we concentrate on the unpolarized case when @xmath68 and the time dependence of entanglement is only due to the transversal component of the angular momentum @xmath69 . \\n photons : ( a ) @xmath26 , ( b ) @xmath70 , ( c ) @xmath71 and ( d ) @xmath72 ( notice the different total duration ) . the time is measured in @xmath73 . \\n , width=480 ]    we present in figure  [ fig : ent ] the results of numerical evaluation of entanglement time dependence calculated according to equation ( [ eq : def_f_ent ] ) . \\n first of all we would like to emphasize that the entanglement reaches the maximum value even in the case when @xmath74 , when the sole entanglement with the atomic state is not sufficient to support @xmath75 . in order to provide a qualitative explanation of the origin of entanglement \\n let us consider a two - photon state . \\n in the basis of population numbers any such state has the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the respective time - dependent amplitudes . \\n using this representation we find for the concurrence @xmath78 the initial condition is determined by the requirement for the state to be disentangled , thus @xmath79 . for a free field the characteristic frequencies of the amplitudes @xmath77 are _ linearly _ proportional to the total number of photons and , as a result , the time dependence factors out in ( [ eq : conc_alphas ] ) yielding @xmath80 , that is the state remains disentangled . \\n however , as can be seen from heisenberg representation ( [ eq : ev_op ] ) , the interaction with the atom essentially modifies the dependence of the characteristic frequencies on the number of photons , which becomes @xmath81 . \\n thus the time dependence of the first and the second terms in ( [ eq : conc_alphas ] ) is determined by the incommensurate frequencies @xmath82 , which inevitably leads to the phase desynchronizing and to the violation of the condition @xmath83 . \\n the second important consequence of the involvement of incommensurate frequencies into the dynamics is the complex ( quasi - periodic ) profile of @xmath0 , which dominates the time dependence of entanglement after the initial regular raise with the typical time scale @xmath84 . \\n this makes @xmath0 to some extent unpredictable and imposes strong requirements with regard to the control of the life time of the photons inside the cavity and to the initial conditions . \\n the addition of a single photon drastically changes the value of entanglement at any particular instant beyond the period of initial raise . \\n it should be noted , however , that when the number of photons in the cavity increases the contribution of particular frequencies becomes less important and the profile of @xmath0 changes toward some general regular shape . \\n the initial stage of the transformation can be seen by comparing figures  [ fig : ent]c and [ fig : ent]d . \\n the detailed analysis of the regular profile in the limit @xmath85 will be provided elsewhere . here \\n we would like to note that the normalized value of the average angular momentum can be presented in this limit as a periodic sequence of gaussian bumps with the characteristic period @xmath86 and the typical entanglement time @xmath87 . \\n we have considered the time dependence of entanglement of initially disentangled few - photons states within the two - mode jaynes - cummings model . \\n the processes of absorption and re - emission of photons with different polarizations are assumed independent and , therefore , the dynamics of  @xmath1\"- and \\n @xmath2\"-polarized photons is completely separable . applying the standard description of entanglement \\n straightforwardly this may seem to imply that the states with different polarizations will stay disentangled . \\n however , the indistinguishability of the photons leads to the necessity to apply the standard picture with the special care . \\n indeed , except in the simplest case , when all photons have the same polarization , each photon is always in the superposition of the states and , therefore , is always affected by  both parts \" of the dynamics . as a result , in order to make a conclusion regarding entanglement one has to consider closely the evolution of the relation between the amplitudes . \\n we have studied the photon entanglement using the formalism of the single - particle density matrix . \\n we have established the relation between the entanglement and the magnitude of the average angular momentum defined with the help of schwinger s model . using this relation and the exact heisenberg representation of the photon creation and annihilation operators \\n we have calculated the time dependence of entanglement @xmath0 . \\n we have shown that @xmath0 has two important features . \\n the interaction with the single atom may lead to complete entanglement @xmath88 . \\n this is related to the fact that the characteristic frequencies determining the time evolution of the photon amplitudes depend _ non - linearly _ on the population numbers . in turn , the superposition of oscillations with incommensurate frequencies results in quasi - periodic @xmath0 with complex profile , especially in the few - photon case @xmath89 . \\n the specific form of the profile drastically depends on the number of particles and transforms into a regular pattern in the limit @xmath85 , \\n 10              s.  tanzilli , h.  de riedmatten , w.  tittel , h.  zbinden , p.  baldi , m.  de micheli , d.  b. ostrowski , and n.  gisin . \\n highly efficient photon -

free ) continuum state with the corresponding momentum @xmath39 around @xmath37 . for simplicity , we label this continuum state @xmath40 with its energy @xmath41 following the electron dynamics . the motivation for using continuum states rather than the usual plane wave / volkov states / coulomb waves/   is to account for the specific influence of the potential at hand  @xcite , e.g. , when the electron is close to the core region . \\n altogether , the scwf model then yields : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are related to the ionization yield and phase respectively ( see section  [ sec : scwf : bound_state_and_ionization ] ) , @xmath45 corresponds to the phase accumulated by the scfw trajectory , while @xmath46 accounts for the quantum spread of the wavefunction in the continuum ( see section  [ sec : scwf : trajectory ] ) . in the past \\n , the use of semi -

like tail , one can consider substituting coulomb waves instead of the volkov states in the previous equations and adapt the subsequent analysis accordingly \\n . generally speaking , for a given potential , the scwf approximation consists of selecting an appropriate dynamics for the position , momentum , standard deviation , phase and energy . \\n irrespective of this specific choice , in what follows we will assume @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the classical counterpart to the hamiltonian operator @xmath60 , and we use hamilton s equations in place of the tdse . \\n the phase derivative equation ensures that , in the limit of infinite standard deviation @xmath61 , the quantum dynamics for the continuum state @xmath62 is satisfied . \\n as we shall see , this approximation is very useful whenever the phase derivative is needed in theoretical investigations .      for the sake of simplicity , we assume the bound part of the wavefunction to be a single , field - free , eigenstate  @xcite  in most cases the ground state  which we denote @xmath47 as illustrated in the left part of fig .  [ \\n fig : potential_illustration ] . \\n we neglect laser induced spatial variations of the bound state and compute the complex ionization potential @xmath63 for a static electric field with amplitude @xmath64 , using a complex rotation  @xcite . \\n then , the bound part dynamics of eq . \\n ( [ eq : wavefunction_decomposition ] ) is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the stark - shifted bound - state energy and @xmath67 the ionization rate with @xmath68 . \\n from the bound state dynamics , we can now derive the initial , ionization step  @xmath0 , condition for the ionized part of the wavefunction in eq . \\n ( [ eq : scwf ] ) . \\n indeed , given that bound and continuum eigenstates of the hamiltonian operator form a generalized orthonormal basis , if we neglect recapture of previously ionized electrons , charge conservation imposes @xmath69 where we have neglected the effect of the gaussian profile on the cross terms when computing the total charge . \\n taking the derivative of the previous equality and using eq . \\n ( [ eq : bound_state_dynamics ] ) after a short calculation we get @xmath70 in the low ionization regime , when bound state depletion can be ignored , the amplitude coefficient simply becomes @xmath71 . \\n finally , the adiabatic approximation applied to the ionization phase leads to @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the phase accumulated only during the ionization process and the first term on the right - hand side reflects the synchronization of the ionized part of the wavefunction with the bound state phase at the instant of ionization . \\n we now have all the key ingredients to express the dipole signal and , in turn , its associated hhg spectrum using the scwf approximation for the wavefunction dynamics . from eq . \\n ( [ eq : wavefunction_decomposition ] ) , combined with the dipole definition  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum ] ) , we identify three main contributions to the dipole signal . from these three , \\n we ignore the contributions from the bound - bound and continuum - continuum state coupling ( due to its low frequency spectrum , and its second - order importance compared to the bound - continuum component , respectively ) . \\n we isolate the contributions from each initial ionization time and define the complex dipole acceleration element @xmath74 where the bound state amplitude and phase are given by eqs . \\n ( [ eq : bound_state_dynamics ] ) and the total dipole acceleration is obtained by integrating over ionization times @xmath75 with @xmath76 the complex conjugate . from the definition of the scwf  ( [ eq : scwf ] ) , after appropriate factorization , one can isolate the three steps of the recollision model in the complex acceleration dipole    @xmath77    where `` @xmath78 '' is the complex conjugate of the ionization potential . \\n the first step,@xmath0 ionization , has been set by hand in the model through the adiabatic approximation and there is therefore little surprise to find it here . on the other hand , \\n the clear separation between the second,@xmath1 propagation , and the third,@xmath2 rescattering , was not predetermined and is a direct consequence of the scwf model . \\n the factorization  ( [ eq : complex_dipole : factorization ] ) makes clear that the complex dipole signal associated with a given scwf is the product of the ionization , propagation and recollision cross sections . \\n note though that this factorization is expressed here in the time domain . in this section \\n we investigate how the factorization maps to the frequency domain and , more interestingly for our purpose , to hhg spectra . \\n first we investigate the factorization when the propagation part is described with a a reference system that only shares generic features with the system at hand , for instance a long - range coulomb tail away from the core , as in the qrs formalism  @xcite ( section  [ sec : hhg_factorization : reference_system ] ) . \\n while the use of such a reference provides very good results for hhg spectrum predictions , it sheds little light on the propagation step  @xmath1 which is treated as a black box . \\n alternatively , this question can be investigated with the scwf perspective taking advantage of the trajectory component of the model  ( section  [ sec : hhg_factorization : direct_factorization ] ) . \\n more specifically , it allows us to disentangle the individual contributions from all the trajectories that contribute to the hhg spectrum and enables us to compare the relative contributions @xmath79 .    for consistency with our choice of computing hhg spectra using the acceleration form of the dipole signal , in what follows \\n we discuss the factorization using the acceleration scattering cross - section @xmath80 . \\n a similar analysis can be carried out using the dipole form and its associated scattering cross - section @xmath81 . \\n the equivalence between the two factorization forms will be discussed in the end of section  [ sec : hhg_factorization : reference_system ] . \\n the central idea behind using a reference system is to approximate the propagation term @xmath1 as a black box by including some of the effects of the potential at hand . to be a good candidate \\n , the reference system should be easy to compute and/or common to a wide range of parameters under investigation where the reference is computed once and then reused throughout the parameter analysis . for our illustration of molecular models of potential  ( [ eq : potential ] ) we investigate the dependance of the hhg spectrum with the polarization angle @xmath82 . \\n similarly to the qrs formalism we define the reference spectrum @xmath83  more generally we will label all data associated with the reference system with primes  with identical ( field - free ) ionization potential  @xcite and similar potential shape away from the core region . in our case , such a reference can be taken to be the system at a given angle , e.g. , @xmath84 where the potential becomes the one for a sae atomic target as illustrated in fig . \\n [ fig : potential_illustration ] . \\n then , from the definition of the hhg spectrum  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum ] ) and using the linearity of the fourier transform we apply the swcf approximation to the dipole accelerations  ( [ eq : complex_dipole : factorization ] ) and get @xmath85\\\\left(\\\\nu\\\\right ) + c.c .          } , \\\\ ] ] with @xmath86 $ ] . \\n intuitively , we see that the key element of the qrs factorization \\n e.g. , eqs . \\n ( 1 ) and  ( 4 ) of ref . \\n @xcite  consists of moving the relative dipole acceleration @xmath87 outside of the fourier transform as a global multiplicative factor . in what follows \\n we investigate the theoretical grounds for doing so . \\n as discussed previously , we consider hhg in the low ionization regime where bound state depletion can be neglected such that the ionization part  @xmath0 of the ratio @xmath87 simplifies to @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the ionization phase difference with the reference system . \\n numerical computations of ionization rates show a very generic shape for systems with comparable ionization potential such that , at the leading order , @xmath90 , irrespective of the ionization time @xmath32 . for higher laser intensities , where the bound state depopulation effects can be neglected over _ one _ laser cycle but not for the _ full _ duration of the pulse , using the argument that similar dipole signals are produced every laser period , \\n the previous equation can be modified taking into account the ionization yield over a laser cycle . \\n because of the integration over the laser cycle , the ionization factor is independent of the ionization time @xmath32 within a cycle . as a consequence , integrating over the laser pulse duration , the overall ionization ratio is also independent of @xmath32 and @xmath91 . \\n we now turn to the propagation part  @xmath1 of the dipole acceleration ratio . \\n this term describes the ionized electron dynamics in the continuum , i.e. , mostly when the electron is far away from the core . beyond the sfa picture , using a reference system with similar potential shape offers a much better description of this electron dynamics away from the core . \\n we illustrate this point in the right part of fig . \\n [ fig : scwf ] where only a zoom allows to differentiate between the system and reference continuum states away from the core and this difference is associated with a phase shift ( @xmath92 ) . \\n in the previous paragraph , we have ruled out effects of the bound state depopulation such that the only possible source of difference between the system and reference comes from their respective bound state energy stark - shift . \\n we assume that the stark shift of the system and its reference are the same to leading order ( which is a good approximation at moderate intensity ) and would therefore cancel in the ratio @xmath93 . \\n now looking at the overall dipole acceleration  ( [ eq : complex_dipole : factorization ] ) we notice that the phase term in @xmath1 is the only fast oscillating factor , compared to all the other terms which vary on the time scale imposed by the laser frequency @xmath31 . the instantaneous hhg frequency , defined as the time derivative of the total phase , is then : @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the real part and we have used eq . \\n ( [ eq : scwf_trajectory ] ) for the phase derivative . \\n this instantaneous frequency will be discussed in further detail in section  [ sec : hhg_factorization : direct_factorization ] , for now it provides a link between the hhg frequency and electronic energy .    for atomic and small molecular systems the bound part of the wavefunction @xmath96 is localized in space and we define @xmath97 as the characteristic function over this region , i.e. , @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 elsewhere . without loss of generality \\n we use the same characteristic function for both the system and reference . \\n this could for instance be achieved by increasing the respective characteristic domains to make them match . as is illustrated in fig . \\n [ fig : scwf ] , the width of the ionized part of the wavefunction is typically much larger than that of the bound part . intuitively , this can be understood by the fact that right after ionization the electron is usually localized in momentum space . moving this picture in position \\n initializes the ionized part of the wavefunction with a relatively large width @xmath101 and is further amplified through quantum spread in the continuum . as a consequence we have @xmath102 which approximates the gaussian envelope with its mean value over the characteristic function @xmath97 domain , and thus @xmath103 a similar approximation can be written for the reference system . again , because of the similarity between the potential with the reference model we expect @xmath104 in the region away from the core such that the prefactors to the bound - continuum acceleration dipole element in the previous equation cancel in the rescattering part of the dipole acceleration ratio @xmath105 already we see the central role played by the scattering states in the hhg spectrum , as emphasized by the qrs approximation  @xcite as compared to the sfa where plane waves are used . in fig . \\n [ fig : scattering_cross_section ] we display the angle resolved cross - section for the molecular models  ( [ eq : potential ] ) we consider here . for both molecular models \\n we notice that the two center interference generates a singularity in the scattering cross - section whose position in energy depends on the angle @xmath12 . \\n note , though , that when the laser is perpendicular to the molecular axis ( @xmath14 , see upper part of the fig . \\n [ fig : scattering_cross_section ] ) , the singularity disappears , which makes this a good candidate as a reference since it avoids dividing by zero in the previous equation . \\n ( color online ) polarization angle resolved acceleration scattering cross -

section_ratio ] ) is obtained using the instantaneous frequency approximation and reads @xmath113 in eq . \\n ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : reference_atom : convolution ] ) . since the reference system dynamics away from the core is assumed to reproduce the one for the system at hand we further consider @xmath114 . \\n the last term we are left to deal with in the hhg spectrum factorization is the ionization phase difference @xmath115 . \\n most ionization models attribute similar ionization effects to potentials with identical field - free ionization potentials and we therefore ignore this additional phase altogether @xmath116 . in the end , we arrive at the hhg spectrum factorization from the reference system @xmath117 given that @xmath118}+c.c.$ ] . as emphasized in the qrs formulation  @xcite , the dipole acceleration element ratio @xmath119 contains phase information due to the phase difference of field - free continuum eigenstates ( denoted @xmath92 on the right most part of fig . \\n [ fig : potential_illustration ] ) . \\n we finish by noticing that one can also substitute the dipole element ratio @xmath120 in eq . \\n ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : reference_atom : factorization ] ) , e.g. , using the approximation @xmath121 , and that this corresponds to the standard formulation of the qrs factorization  @xcite .    to conclude this section , in fig . \\n [ fig : hhg_reference_system ] we compare the spectrum factorization using a reference system  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : reference_atom : factorization ] ) with the result of a full quantum simulation  panels ( b ) and ( a ) respectively . \\n as demonstrated in qrs analyses  @xcite , such a factorization offers a very good approximation of the actual result as the two spectra are very similar . \\n in particular , we notice that both spectra exhibit a local minimum around @xmath122 , labeled with vertical dashed lines , which is associated with a singularity in the scattering cross section ( see upper right panel of fig . \\n [ fig : scattering_cross_section ] ) . on the other hand , looking at the lower panel of fig . \\n [ fig : hhg_reference_system ] ( c ) we see that using the plane wave scattering cross - section in the spectrum factorization yields poor results ( the local minimum is shifted by about @xmath123 . \\n this discrepancy illustrates the crucial importance of using continuum states for the system at hand , rather than plane waves ( e.g. , volkov states ) , in the scwf  ( [ eq : scwf ] ) . \\n ( color online ) hhg spectrum for the @xmath27 molecular ion model of potential  ( [ eq : potential ] ) with parallel molecular and polarization directions ( @xmath13 ) . for the simulations \\n , we integrate the tdse over 10 laser cycles with @xmath124 and @xmath125 laser intensity and wavelength , respectively . from up to down , we compare spectra obtained from ( a ) the full quantum dynamics with eq . \\n ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum ] ) to ( b - c ) the reference system factorization  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : reference_atom : factorization ] ) using scattering and plane waves respectively  @xcite . for indication , on each panel , the vertical dashed line labels the hhg energy associated with the singularity in the acceleration scattering cross section as seen in the upper right panel of fig .  [ fig : scattering_cross_section ] . ]      as illustrated in fig . \\n [ fig : hhg_reference_system ] , and more generally discussed in qrs analyses  @xcite , the use of a reference system is interesting in that it offers very good , quantitatively comparable , results compared with the full quantum simulations . for appropriately chosen systems , such as a scaled hydrogen atom , the computation of the reference hhg spectrum can be evaluated numerically relatively cheaply with modern technology . yet , beyond the computational point of view , from the theoretical perspective , one of the drawbacks of using a reference system is that it treats the propagation step  @xmath1 as a black box from which little physical insight is gained . on the other hand , \\n insightful electron trajectory pictures have been developed for the interpretation of hhg spectra , for instance the well - known short and long trajectories with linearly polarized lasers  @xcite . in this section \\n we connect the trajectory component of the scwf to the propagation component  @xmath1 of the spectrum which leads us to a direct factorization of the hhg spectrum . \\n in particular , this analysis allows to separate the contributions from each such trajectory and to compare the relative importance of the three steps @xmath79 to the spectrum .    in this context \\n , the analysis is the same irrespective of the polarization angle and , for the sake of simplicity , in what follows we omit the @xmath12 parameter dependence in equations when there is no confusion possible . \\n we start again from the scwf approximation in which contributions to the harmonic spectrum are separated by ionization time . \\n we define the element @xmath126\\\\left(\\\\nu\\\\right),\\\\ ] ] such that @xmath127    for typical atomic and small molecular systems , the bound part of the wavefunction is localized in a well defined part of space , which we denoted with the characteristic function @xmath97 in the previous section . in comparison , \\n the ionized electron dynamics extends over much larger excursion distances , as illustrated in fig . \\n [ fig : scwf ] . as a consequence , \\n the trajectory component of the scwf model allows for the definition of a recollision time @xmath128 when the electron returns to the core ( or the time of closest return depending on the chosen model ) , if any . in our case of potential  ( [ eq : potential ] ) , the recollision time for a given trajectory \\n is defined by the implicit equation @xmath129 . \\n then , considering a linearization of the trajectory around this recollision time , combined with the comparatively large gaussian width of the scwf , the spatial averaging  ( [ eq : dipole_acceleration_element ] ) can be expressed in the temporal domain @xmath130 for some standard deviation @xmath131 related to the parameters of the problem at hand . \\n looking at the terms composing the complex dipole acceleration element  ( [ eq : complex_dipole : factorization ] ) we notice a clear separation of time scales between the different terms . \\n on the one hand , the phase coefficient in propagation  @xmath1 , @xmath132 , exhibits a rapid variation in time . \\n as introduced in the previous section we define its time derivative , @xmath133 using the trajectory phase derivative approximation  ( [ eq : scwf_trajectory ] ) and neglecting any stark shift . on the other hand , the term @xmath134 like the other time - dependent coefficients in eq . \\n ( [ eq : complex_dipole : factorization ] ) evolves with the characteristic time scale of the swcf electron dynamics , i.e. , very slowly  typically with the frequency of the driving laser @xmath31 . \\n we then consider a linearization of the phase around the recollision time which allows for a computation of the hhg spectrum element  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum_element ] ) @xmath135 where the second and third factors of eq . \\n ( [ eq : complex_dipole : factorization ] ) are evaluated at the recollision time . in the limit of large @xmath131 \\n we notice that @xmath136 { } \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi } \\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\nu-\\\\nu\\\\left(t_{0};t_{r}\\\\right)\\\\right),\\\\ ] ] the dirac delta distribution . taking this limit \\n when summing over ionization times , we see that the overall hhg spectrum adds up to the coherent superposition of the contributions from all ionization times leading to the same recollision frequency @xmath137    from the previous equation  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : direct_factorization ] ) we recover the direct link between semi - classical trajectories of the scwf and harmonics in the hhg spectrum . for example , in the sfa and linear polarization , the sum over ionization times @xmath138 corresponds to finding the short , long and possible multiple recollision trajectories leading to a given harmonic frequency . breaking down the factors in the individual contributions for a given trajectory , we get @xmath139 where we have neglected bound state depopulation and recall @xmath140  ( [ eq : instantaneous_frequency ] ) . furthermore \\n , in the previous equation we remark that the variations of the @xmath46 factor  associated with quantum spread in the propagation term  are much slower than that of the ionization and rescattering factors . \\n this is made obvious in the sfa where @xmath141 in the limit of large propagation times . \\n we see that the linear dependence is negligible compared to the typical exponential variations over several orders of magnitude that normally occur in both the ionization and scattering cross - section ( as can be seen in fig . \\n [ fig : scattering_cross_section ] for the latter ) . from this perspective , the variations of the propagation factor can be neglected and the trajectory contribution is reduced to @xmath142    for simplicity , we use the sfa to compute the scwf trajectory component  although as discussed in section  [ sec : scwf : trajectory ] , a more refined model including the effects of the potential could also be considered . in the upper panel of fig . \\n [ fig : spectrum_decomposition ] we compare the contributions of short and long trajectories ( see labels on the figure ) using prediction  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : trajectory_contribution ] ) with the hhg spectrum of a full quantum simulation . in our configuration \\n , we see that the long trajectory contribution qualitatively reproduces the overall shape of the full hhg spectrum and dominates the short trajectory component . \\n this can be easily understood with the fact that long trajectories are born around the maxima of the electric field \\n therefore with the higher ionization rate in the adiabatic approximation  while short trajectories are initiated later on , when the instantaneous field is weaker . more generally note that , for a given harmonic energy , in the factorization framework we have developed here , both short and long ( and multiple recollision ) trajectories share the same rescattering cross section . as a consequence , \\n the difference in their respective contribution amplitudes can only come from the ionization  @xmath0 and propagation  @xmath1 factors . \\n ( color online ) comparison between the full quantum hhg spectrum with the prediction  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : trajectory_contribution ] ) for short and long ( upper panel , see labels ) trajectories and the coherent superposition of both ( lower ) from eq . \\n ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : direct_factorization ] ) . the proportionality coefficient in  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : trajectory_contribution ] ) has been chosen such as to get best match with the full hhg computation . as illustrated in the figure \\n , the lower panel focuses on the part of the spectrum between @xmath143 and @xmath144 where only one short and one long trajectory ( no multiple recollision ) contribute to the spectrum in the sfa . \\n the system ( @xmath27 ) , laser and computation parameters are the same as of fig .  [ fig : hhg_reference_system ] . ]    since more than one trajectory contributes to the hhg spectrum , following eq . \\n ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : direct_factorization ] ) , they should be added coherently , that is including their respective phases . \\n we display such a coherent superposition of both short and long trajectories , where their respective amplitudes are computed with eq . \\n ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : trajectory_contribution ] ) , in the lower part of fig . \\n [ fig : spectrum_decomposition ] . in the panel \\n we focus on the harmonics between @xmath143 and @xmath144 where only one short and one long trajectory ( no multiple recollision ) contribute to the hhg spectrum according to the sfa , and @xmath145 is the ponderomotive energy . when compared to the full quantum spectrum , we see that the coherent superposition of both short and long trajectories reproduces very well the oscillation pattern observed in the spectrum . \\n we take it as a further proof of the relevance of the scwf analysis and predictions of eqs . \\n ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : direct_factorization ] ) and  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : trajectory_contribution ] ) .    compared to the reference system version , \\n the direct factorization bypasses the computation of a quantum hhg spectrum altogether . beyond this kind of computational considerations , and \\n more interestingly , the direct factorization offers an intuitive interpretation of spectra in terms of electron trajectories and allows to disentangle their respective contributions to the spectrum . \\n this separation is essential in experimental measurements and models including macroscopic propagation of the hhg field where typical phase matching conditions restrict the contribution to a given harmonics from ( at most ) a single identified trajectory  @xcite . in this context the individual spectra of isolated systems , \\n as provided with the reference system factorization , are quite different from the macroscopic counterpart as it lacks the filtering imposed on trajectories that are not phase matched . \\n to summarize , we have introduced the semi - classical wavefunction ( scwf ) approximation which combines the wave / particle picture of the electron dynamics : it is supported by a semi - classical trajectory while incorporating a spatially delocalized extension of the wavefunction . \\n this intuitive framework , applied to high - harmonic generation ( hhg ) allows the factorization of the spectrum as the product of the ionization  @xmath0 , propagation  @xmath1 and rescattering  @xmath2 cross - sections in energy ( frequency ) space . \\n the propagation component can be described with a reference system  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : reference_atom : factorization ] ) as in the quantitative rescattering ( qrs ) formalism  @xcite . \\n alternatively , the factorization can be performed directly using the trajectory perspective of the scwf  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : direct_factorization ] ) and  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : trajectory_contribution ] ) .    in figure \\n [ fig : angle_resolved_spectrum ] , we compare the accuracy of the two factorizations ( middle and lower panels ) in approximating the full quantum spectra ( upper panels ) . \\n more specifically , we display the intensity of odd harmonics ( which gives the global envelope of the harmonic comb ) between @xmath143 and @xmath144 energy , as the polarization angle @xmath12 is varied for the @xmath28 molecule ( left panels ) and @xmath27 molecular ion ( right ) models of potential  ( [ eq : potential ] ) . \\n qualitatively , we see that both factorizations reproduce full quantum results very well . in particular \\n , we see that all three panels present very similar oscillations patterns in photon energy and , as the polarization direction is varied , they all exhibit a local minimum that follows the singularity in the scattering cross - section ( see black curves in the panels ) . \\n for both factorizations though , we see that this local minimum is sharper than in the full quantum computation counterparts . \\n this can be attributed to the fact that in full quantum simulations , the scattering cross - section is expressed in the temporal domain as in eq . \\n ( [ eq : complex_dipole : factorization ] ) while it is directly expressed in the frequency domain for the factorization . in the former case \\n , the singularity can be blurred by higher order effects when computing the fourier transform to compute the hhg spectrum  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum ] ) . on the quantitative level , in fig .  [ \\n fig : angle_resolved_spectrum ] , we observe better results using the reference system ( middle panels ) than with the direct factorization with sfa ( lower ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : hhg_factorization ] , we attribute this to the fact that the reference includes long - range coulomb corrections to the electron dynamics away from the core whereas when choosing the sfa in the direct factorization we ignore such effects altogether .        beyond the results of the factorization derived in this article , \\n the scwf allows the identification of possible perspectives for improving the results of approximate predictions compared to full quantum simulations . for the reference system of eq . \\n ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : reference_atom : factorization ] ) there is not much obvious room for improvement apart from potentially fine tuning the energy correspondence @xmath114 in the scattering cross - section . on the other hand , \\n the direct factorization , with a direct access to the propagation step and underlying trajectories , leaves more perspectives for improvement . \\n one such logical possibility is accounting for the energy stark - shift  @xcite in both the bound part of the wavefunction and instantaneous frequency . \\n this formalism also leaves room for including laser induced bound state deformation  @xcite . \\n this work was supported by u.s . \\n department of energy , office of science , office of basic energy sciences , under award no . \\n de - sc0012462 .\",\n",

cep ) , may provide a baseline contribution to the measured cumulants from data . as proposed in  @xcite \\n , there are different combinations of cumulants of protons and pions which are independent of qcd based coupling parameters . \\n some of such cumulant ratios are : @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 . \\n where , @xmath113 are the cumulants of different order with @xmath114 and @xmath52 being the proton or pion . in case of non - interacting particles in the classical boltzmann regime , in the absence of critical fluctuations , the fluctuations of particle number follow poisson statistics . hence , after subtracting the poisson contribution from the above cumulant ratios , one can predict the contributions of critical fluctuations in the cumulant ratios . \\n these subtracted cumulant ratios will be at 1 in the proximity of the critical point . \\n however , keeping in mind that the experimental measurements are performed within a finite kinematic acceptance and can accept only a fraction of particles , the hrg model based baseline will be a better substitute compared to poisson expectations . \\n we have estimated the baseline for the above cumulant ratios using the hrg model , which will give the thermal contribution to the cumulant ratios . \\n the first two ratios are the ratios of the skewness and kurtosis of protons and pions , where skewness @xmath115 and kurtosis @xmath116 . \\n the last two ratios involve mixed cumulants of protons and pions . in the hrg model \\n , there is no interaction between the particles , hence the contribution of mixed cumulants will be zero . \\n figure  [ fig : mixedratios_ppi ] shows the first three ratios , defined above , as a function . \\n the upper panel of fig . \\n [ fig : mixedratios_ppi ] shows the different cumulant ratios by taking primordial pions and protons , the lower panel show the cumulant ratios of protons and pions which have contributions from both primordial as well as resonance decay . \\n these ratios are calculated using the hrg model should and can be considered as baseline instead of poisson contribution as baseline . \\n in summary , keeping in mind the importance of mixed susceptibilities and pion - proton cumulants in unraveling the phase structure of qcd , we have provided the variation of these observables as a function of colliding beam energy within the ambit of a hrg model . \\n the results presented in this paper will provide the required baseline for the corresponding measurements in the experiments . \\n we have studied the effect of experimental acceptance on the ratios of the mixed susceptibilities using a hadron resonance gas model . \\n we have considered @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ratios , which have contributions from charged baryons ( anti - baryons ) , charged strange or baryon strange particles . \\n there is a small dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the above susceptibility ratios . \\n however , there is a strong energy dependence for all the ratios . \\n these susceptibility ratios are very sensitive to the different charge states . in a real experimental situation \\n , it is difficult to measure the strange baryons ( @xmath74 and higher masses strange baryons ) on an event - by - event basis and calculate their cumulants for fluctuations , specially at lower beam energies . instead we have concentrated on measurable ratios like @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 and presented the hrg expectations for primordial and resonance decay contributions . \\n we have also provided a hrg based calculation of realistic baseline ( non - cep expectation ) for a set of new observables recently proposed for critical fluctuations using the different combinations of cumulant ratios of protons and pions  @xcite . \\n the experimentally measured values of these ratios , after subtraction of the non - cep contributions , are expected to be at unity in presence of cep . these cumulant ratios of proton and pion from the hrg model calculations are observed to increase as a function of . \\n these ratios calculated using the hrg model should be used as baseline instead of poisson expectation for the interpretation of data related to qcd critical point . \\n m.  a.  stephanov , k.  rajagopal and e.  v.  shuryak , phys . \\n lett .   * 81 * , 4816 ( 1998 ) . \\n m.  g.  alford , k.  rajagopal and f.  wilczek , phys . \\n b * 422 * , 247 ( 1998 ) . \\n y.  aoki , g.  endrodi , z.  fodor , s.  d.  katz and k.  k.  szabo , nature * 443 * , 675 ( 2006 ) . \\n m.  asakawa , u.  w.  heinz and b.  muller , phys . \\n * 85 * , 2072 ( 2000 ) . \\n m.  asakawa , s.  ejiri and m.  kitazawa , phys . \\n lett .   * 103 * , 262301 ( 2009 ) . \\n m.  a.  stephanov , prog . \\n suppl .   * 153 * , 139 ( 2004 ) ; int . \\n j.  mod . \\n a * 20 * , 4387 ( 2005 ) . \\n m.  m.  aggarwal _ et al . \\n _ [ star collaboration ] , phys . \\n * 105 * , 022302 ( 2010 ) . \\n l.  adamczyk _ et al . _ [ star collaboration ] , phys . \\n lett .   * 112 * , 032302 ( 2014 ) . \\n l.  adamczyk _ et al . \\n _ [ star collaboration ] , phys . \\n lett .   * 113 * , 092301 ( 2014 ) . \\n a.  adare _ et al . \\n _ [ phenix collaboration ] , phys . \\n c * 93 * , 011901 ( 2016 ) . s.  gupta , x.  luo , b.  mohanty , h.  g.  ritter and n.  xu , science * 332 * , 1525 ( 2011 ) . \\n a.  bazavov _ et al . \\n _ [ hotqcd collaboration ] , phys . \\n d * 86 * , 034509 ( 2012 ) . \\n r.  v.  gavai and s.  gupta , phys . \\n d * 65 * , 094515 ( 2002 ) . \\n v.  koch , a.  majumder and j.  randrup , phys . \\n lett .   * 95 * , 182301 ( 2005 ) . \\n a.  majumder and b.  muller , phys . \\n c * 74 * , 054901 ( 2006 ) . \\n r.  v.  gavai and s.  gupta , phys . \\n d * 73 * , 014004 ( 2006 ) . \\n a.  bazavov , h.  t.  ding , p.  hegde , o.  kaczmarek , f.  karsch , e.  laermann , s.  mukherjee and p.  petreczky _ et al . \\n _ , phys . \\n * 109 * ( 2012 ) 192302 . \\n s.  borsanyi , z.  fodor , s.  d.  katz , s.  krieg , c.  ratti and k.  szabo , jhep * 1201 * , 138 ( 2012 ) . m.  a.  stephanov , k.  rajagopal and e.  v.  shuryak , phys .  rev . \\n d * 60 * , 114028 ( 1999 ) . \\n z.  fodor and s.  d.  katz , jhep * 0404 * , 050 ( 2004 ) . c.  athanasiou , k.  rajagopal and m.  stephanov , phys . \\n d * 82 * , 074008 ( 2010 ) . \\n m.  a.  stephanov , phys . \\n lett .   * 102 * , 032301 ( 2009 ) . \\n r.  v.  gavai and s.  gupta , phys . \\n b * 696 * , 459 ( 2011 ) . \\n m.  cheng , p.  hegde , c.  jung , f.  karsch , o.  kaczmarek , e.  laermann , r.  d.  mawhinney and c.  miao _ et al . \\n _ , phys . \\n d * 79 * , 074505 ( 2009 ) . \\n m.  a.  stephanov , phys . \\n lett .   * 107 * ( 2011 ) 052301 . \\n braun -

       " {'article': 'four - dimensional conformal field theories have attracted much attention in the last decade , mainly because of their relevance in the context of the ads / cft correspondence and its developments as well as its applications in completely different fields of which condensed matter is an example . \\n the conformal symmetry imposes stringent constraints on the theory @xcite . in the case of two dimensions , for example , where scale invariance implies conformal invariance , \\n the symmetry is enough to solve the theory @xcite . in four and higher dimensions , \\n this is in general not true @xcite , since examples are known of theories with scale but not conformal symmetry @xcite , but meaningful statements can be made as well ( e.g. @xcite for the four - dimensional case ) . \\n moreover , in the presence of supersymmetry , superconformal invariance puts restrictions on the operator scaling dimensions , independently of the space - time dimensionality @xcite .    for these theories , \\n a great deal of information can be obtained from the conformal group , that in four dimensions is @xmath3 and that acts non - linearly on the coordinates , due to the presence of operations such as the inversion and the special conformal transformations . \\n however , it has been long known that it is possible to formulate the theory in such a way that the conformal group will act linearly on the coordinates , in the same fashion as the angular momentum does . \\n in addition , correlation functions automatically exhibit manifest conformal symmetry and any results written in terms of the embedding coordinates are valid not just in minkowski space but in any conformally flat space - time . \\n this approach goes back to @xcite and had applications to m / string theory branes @xcite as well as to more complicated conformal field theories in @xcite ( in particular @xcite generalizes the construction from scalars to more generic tensor fields ) . \\n moreover , embeddings of chiral conformal superspaces were considered in @xcite , in terms of off - shell twistors @xcite , while @xcite and @xcite review the general ( chiral and non - chiral ) case . \\n in particular , using the twistor notation , @xcite gives the two - point correlators between chiral and anti - chiral superfields for arbitrary @xmath2 . in some cases , \\n @xmath4-point correlators have been calculated for various values of @xmath4 ( see for example @xcite where @xmath5 and the primaries are not chiral superfields ) . the supertwistor approach was also used in @xcite to study the superconformal structure of 4d @xmath6 compactified harmonic / projective superspace . \\n the results presented here ( as well as in @xcite ) are equivalent to those obtained with twistor calculations .    in the embedding method , \\n one introduces two additional coordinates and embeds the four - dimensional space - time into a larger six - dimensional space with signature @xmath7 . in this space \\n the conformal group generators act as angular momenta . \\n the four - dimensional space is recovered by constraining the six -

dimensional superspace is a coset space where points are labelled by @xmath142 and the symmetries above have been modded out . \\n we denote the whole set of theta coordinates by curly brackets : @xmath143 the explicit transformation that brings the origin to the point @xmath142 in superspace is a product of two commuting transformations , one in ordinary space -

vanishing parameter , we get the following transformations :    [ 4d space - time superconformal transformations ] @xmath166    including also the barred half superspace given by @xmath112 , one gets the full superspace spanned by the coordinates @xmath167 . \\n @xmath0 conformal chiral superfields , @xmath168 , were considered in @xcite . defining a chiral superfield on the light - cone @xmath169 and expanding in powers of theta @xmath170 with @xmath171 \\n , it was checked that the component fields transform as a chiral multiplet under the @xmath0 super poincar group and have non - trivial rules under the special conformal transformations . in particular , \\n the highest component @xmath172 is a chiral primary operator , in the sense that it is annihilated by the special superconformal generators @xmath173 and @xmath174 , which are related to the supercharges by @xmath175 moreover , under the @xmath176 @xmath94-symmetry , one recovers the fact that the @xmath94-charge is proportional to the scaling dimension @xmath177 at a superconformal fixed point @xcite , according to @xmath178 actually , this result continues to hold in the case of extended supersymmetry . under @xmath21 the indices @xmath179 transform with a unitary matrix :    @xmath180    on the light - cone we define @xmath181 where the components are functions of ( @xmath182 ) . \\n hence , as @xmath183 is a scalar , i.e. @xmath184 we find @xmath185 under @xmath186 . \\n this result is the same as in the @xmath0 case , as we wanted to show . in the above equation \\n we have used that @xmath187 and hence @xmath188 , @xmath189 , as well as the projective property @xmath190 with @xmath191 .    under a generic superconformal transformation generated by the spinor ( [ superconformal parameter ] ) , \\n using the scaling property of the superfield @xmath192 as well as its scalar nature , we have @xmath193 where @xmath194 and the variations @xmath195 and @xmath196 are given by ( [ 4d space -

time superconformal transformations ] ) , for special conformal transformations , @xmath262 ( the vertical bar denoting the @xmath263 component of the r.h.s . \\n , which corresponds to taking the spinorial @xmath264-component of @xmath183 ) will always be proportional to @xmath265 and hence will vanish at the origin . \\n in this paper we generalized the construction of superembedding methods for 4d @xmath0 in @xcite to embeddings of @xmath2-extended superconformal field theories . in this way , \\n the superconformal group acts linearly on the coordinates of the ambient space , the conformal symmetry is manifest and moreover the method is valid for any conformally flat space , not just minkowski . \\n we have considered explicitly the case of @xmath1 chiral superfields in four dimensions and concluded that any conformal chiral superfield of the @xmath2-extended supersymmetry is generated by a chiral primary operator sitting in its highest component . we have also noted a correspondence between the number of component fields of a certain type in any chiral multiplet of the @xmath2-extended supersymmetry and the entries of the pascal pyramid at layer @xmath2 . \\n this correspondence has been explicitly showed in the cases of @xmath1 and @xmath5 supersymmetry . \\n we have not considered correlation functions , that for @xmath0 were presented in @xcite , neither non - holomorphic operators and higher - rank tensors , which among other things are relevant in ads / cft and its applications . \\n these points are left as open questions . \\n we would like to acknowledge beatriz gato rivera for carefully reading the manuscript , the instituto de fisica teorica in madrid , ift - csic / uam , for hospitality during the completion of this work , warren siegel , andreas stergiou and dimitri sorokin for correspondence , and the npb referee for useful comments . \\n this research has been supported by funding of the project consolider - ingenio 2010 , program cpan ( csd2007 - 00042 ) . \\n for the six - dimensional vector @xmath266 the transformations under the conformal group @xmath3 are @xmath267 , with @xmath268 anti - symmetric . \\n the four - dimensional coordinates @xmath27 are related to the six - dimensional ones by solving the light - cone constraint : @xmath269 using the conventions of @xcite , since and @xmath270 is @xmath271 ] @xmath272 in @xmath8 notation , these transformations are : @xmath273 in the next subsections , we consider the single conformal transformations explicitly \\n . we will also apply these transformations to the origin ( [ origin in spinor notation ] ) and will find the summarizing table [ transformations of the origin ] , that is given here for convenience . \\n .summary of @xmath8 transformations of the origin [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ transformations of the origin ]      the only non - zero parameter is @xmath274 . \\n hence    @xmath275    the second line gives the four - dimensional translation @xmath276 and consistently the third line gives @xmath277 . using ( [ generic su(2,2 ) transformation ] ) one has : @xmath278 when evaluated at the origin , this becomes @xmath279      the only non - zero parameter is @xmath280 . \\n this implies :    @xmath281    the second line implies the four - dimensional lorentz transformation @xmath282 and consistently the third line gives @xmath283 . in @xmath8 notation \\n , one has @xmath284 which vanishes at the origin , @xmath285      here @xmath286 is non - zero and    @xmath287    the first two lines combined give the four - dimensional special conformal transformation @xmath288 with @xmath289 . in @xmath8 notation , one has @xmath290 which vanishes at the origin , @xmath285      the non - vanishing parameter is @xmath291 and    @xmath292    the first two lines combined give the four - dimensional scale transformation @xmath293 while the third line gives consistently @xmath294 . in spinor notation , @xmath295 at the origin this becomes @xmath296 \\n in this appendix we write down some spinor identities that are used in the calculations of the main text . \\n our conventions for the spinors are the same as in @xcite , in particular : @xmath297 where @xmath298 the gamma matrices are given by : @xmath299 and @xmath300 the @xmath3 coordinate @xmath34 and the anti - symmetric @xmath8 tensor @xmath11 are related by @xmath301 and @xmath302    as it is standard in supersymmetry , for each @xmath150 , the product @xmath303 must be proportional to @xmath304 , i.e. @xmath305 , where the proportionality constant @xmath306 is fixed by multiplying both sides by @xmath307 and summing over @xmath308 and @xmath309 ( which gives @xmath310 ) . \\n after anti - commuting the theta s , one finds @xmath311 and hence , for each @xmath150 : @xmath312 this expression was used in ( [ theta factor in the product ] ) . \\n one can make similar manipulations in extended supersymmetry and write ( repeated indices are not summed ) : @xmath313 which were used , for example , in ( [ n=2 components of chiral superfield ] ) with @xmath314 . \\n our conventions for the sigma matrices are as in @xcite and @xcite . \\n in particular , @xmath315 and @xmath316 . \\n these are related by @xmath317 this implies that @xmath318 the former equation was used in ( [ coordinates of 4d superspace ] ) . \\n there , we also used the following relation : @xmath319 this comes from the more generic relation regarding the product of two sigma matrices , which can be expressed in terms of the generators @xmath320 and @xmath321 of the lorentz group in the spinor representation , which are anti - symmetric in the indices @xmath42 and @xmath4 ( see below ) . \\n however , the symmetric part in the space - time indices and the anti - symmetric part in the spinorial indices is fully specified by the metric tensor and the epsilon tensor as : @xmath322}= -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\eta_{\\\\mu\\\\nu}\\\\epsilon^{\\\\dot{a}\\\\dot{b}}\\\\epsilon^{cd}\\\\,.\\\\ ] ] a similar formula holds for the anti - symmetric combination of the dotted indices as well as for the product of two ( unbarred ) sigma matrices .    using the relations above , it is straightforward to check that : @xmath323 these identities were used in ( [ 4d space - time superconformal transformations ] ) \\n . if we only look at the symmetric part in the space - time indices , instead , we have to consider the more general expression @xmath324\\\\,,\\\\ ] ] as it appears in @xcite , which was used in ( [ n=2 components of chiral superfield ] ) . \\n in the translations given in ( [ superconformal transformations ] ) we need to know the inverse of ( [ explicit full transformation in 4d superspace ] ) . because of ( [ full transformation in 4d superspace ] ) , the inverse is a product of the two commuting transformations @xmath325 the space - time part is simply obtained by replacing @xmath326 in ( [ space - time factor in the product ] ) : @xmath327 to compute the theta part , it is convenient to use the following expression for the inversion formula of block matrices : @xmath328 with    * @xmath329 * @xmath330 * @xmath331 * @xmath332 * @xmath333    hence : @xmath334 the complete inverse transformation is then the product of ( [ space - time factor in the product , inverse ] ) and ( [ theta factor in the product , inverse ] ) : @xmath335 where @xmath336 and we have again replaced , for each @xmath150 , @xmath337 . \\n this is enough to derive the set of equations ( [ barred 4d superspace ] ) . \\n in number theory , in analogy to the binomial expansion , whose coefficients can be organized into a triangle , one can consider the trinomial : @xmath338 where the integer numbers appearing in the pascal pyramid ( tetrahedron ) are just the coefficients @xmath339 of the expansion ( see figure [ pyramid ] ) of the trinomial . \\n the power @xmath4 indicates the layer of the pyramid . \\n the pyramid has a huge number of symmetries and interesting properties . \\n for instance , by looking at specific examples or by using some combinatorics , one can check that there are @xmath340 elements at each layer . \\n also , the sum of the entries of each layer is @xmath341 , as can be seen by taking @xmath342 in ( [ trinomial expansion ] ) . \\n moreover , by superimposing two consecutive layers , it is possible to prove that each entry at layer @xmath4 is given by the sum of all the entries at layer @xmath343 that surround it . \\n this is simply a property of the trinomial coefficients .    in number theory , \\n one generalizes binomials and trinomials to multinomials and , in a similar way , we speak of an @xmath42-simplex , which generalizes triangles and tetrahedrons . \\n a multinomial is by definition @xmath344 where the coefficients are given by @xmath345      in ( [ pascal pyramid for n=2 chiral superfield ] ) we have written down the pascal pyramid at layer two and show that its elements are related to the number of certain kind of fields arising as components of an @xmath1 chiral supermultiplet . here \\n we will do the same for @xmath5 chiral supermultiplets and will find the pyramid at layer four .    as we have done in section [ section : the chiral sector ] , a six - dimensional @xmath5 chiral superfield can be expanded in the theta variables as @xmath346 here , @xmath347 can be raised / lowered with the flat ( identity ) metric , all the component fields are functions of @xmath348 and the dots in the end represent quantities that will vanish on the light - cone . \\n the four - dimensional superfield as well as its components are defined on the light - cone and will be functions of @xmath349 only . \\n moreover , the @xmath20-dependence is removed by replacing @xmath350 and expanding everything in @xmath351 . \\n the result is : @xmath352 the fractional coefficients are such that each field appears only once in the sum . \\n the four - dimensional components are expressed in terms of the six - dimensional ones appearing in ( [ 6d chiral n=4 ] ) . \\n for example , for the first few components we have : @xmath353\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\ f^{ij , ab}(y)&= & ( x^+)^{\\\\delta+1}\\\\big[ix_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\epsilon^{ab}e^{ij,\\\\alpha\\\\beta}_{\\\\rm aver.}(x,0 ) -4i\\\\epsilon^{ab}\\\\frac{\\\\partial a_{\\\\rm aver.}}{\\\\partial \\\\varphi_{ij}}(x,0)\\\\big]\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\ f^{i}(y)&= & ( x^+)^{\\\\delta+1}\\\\big[-ix_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}e^{i,\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(x,0)+2i\\\\frac{\\\\partial a}{\\\\partial\\\\varphi_{ii}}(x,0)\\\\big]\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\ \\\\upsilon^{i , abc}(y)&= & ( x^+)^{\\\\delta+2}\\\\big[\\\\epsilon^{ab}ix_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\chi_{\\\\rm aver.}^{i,\\\\alpha\\\\beta c}(x,0 ) + \\\\epsilon^{ab}x^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}y_\\\\mu(\\\\bar{\\\\sigma}^\\\\mu)^{\\\\dot{a}c}\\\\epsilon_{\\\\dot{a}\\\\dot{c}}\\\\chi_{\\\\rm aver.}^{i,\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\dot{c}}(x,0)\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\ & & \\\\phantom{(x^+)^{\\\\delta+2 } } -24i\\\\epsilon^{bc}\\\\epsilon_{ijkl}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\lambda^{ja}}{\\\\partial\\\\varphi_{kl}}(x,0 ) -24\\\\epsilon_{ijkl}\\\\epsilon^{bc}y_\\\\mu(\\\\bar{\\\\sigma}^\\\\mu)^{\\\\dot{a}a}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\lambda^j_{\\\\dot{a}}}{\\\\partial\\\\varphi_{kl}}(x,0)\\\\big]\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\ \\\\upsilon^{i , a}(y)&= & ( x^+)^{\\\\delta+2}\\\\big[-ix_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\chi^{ij,\\\\alpha\\\\beta a}(x,0 ) -x_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}y_\\\\mu(\\\\bar{\\\\sigma}^\\\\mu)^{\\\\dot{c}a}\\\\epsilon_{\\\\dot{c}\\\\dot{d}}\\\\chi^{ij,\\\\dot{d}}(x,0 ) + 2i\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\lambda^{ia}}{\\\\partial\\\\varphi_{ij}}(x,0)\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\ & & \\\\phantom{(x^+)^{\\\\delta+2 } } + y_\\\\mu(\\\\bar{\\\\sigma}^\\\\mu)^{\\\\dot{a}a}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\lambda^i_{\\\\dot{a}}}{\\\\partial\\\\varphi_{jj}}(x,0 ) -i\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\lambda^{ja}}{\\\\partial\\\\varphi_{ij}}(x,0 ) -y_\\\\mu(\\\\bar{\\\\sigma}^\\\\mu)^{\\\\dot{a}a}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\lambda^j_{\\\\dot{a}}}{\\\\partial\\\\varphi_{ij}}(x,0)\\\\big]\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\ \\\\dots&&\\\\dots\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\dots\\\\qquad\\\\dots\\\\qquad\\\\dots\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] etc . here \\n the averaged quantities are defined whenever @xmath246 as done in the main text , e.g. @xmath354 and should be regarded as shorter labels of longer expressions . \\n * one scalar field @xmath355 * four spinors @xmath356 in the representation ( 1/2,0 ) * @xmath357 rank-2 tensors @xmath358 , @xmath359 in the representation ( 1,0 ) * four scalars @xmath360 * four spinors @xmath361 in the representation ( 3/2,0 ) * @xmath362 spinors @xmath363 , @xmath246 , in the representation ( 1/2,0 ) * one rank-4 tensor @xmath364 in the representation ( 2,0 ) * @xmath362 rank-2 tensors @xmath365 , @xmath366 and @xmath367 , in the representation ( 1,0 ) * @xmath368 scalars @xmath369 , @xmath359 and symmetric in @xmath370 * four spinors @xmath371 in the representation ( 3/2,0 ) * @xmath372 spinors @xmath373 , @xmath367 and symmetric in @xmath374 , in the representation ( 1/2,0 ) * six rank-2 tensors @xmath375 , @xmath359 and symmetric in @xmath374 , in the representation ( 1,0 ) * @xmath376 scalars @xmath377 , symmetric in @xmath378 * four spinors @xmath379 , in the representation ( 1/2,0 ) * one scalar @xmath380 .    this field content can be summarized by using the pascal pyramid at layer @xmath5 : @xmath381 the total number of fields is given by the sum of the elements of the pyramid and amounts , as it should be , to @xmath382 . \\n a.  m.  polyakov , `` non -

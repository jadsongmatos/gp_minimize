       "[{'article': \"the _ spitzer _ space telescope ( _ spitzer _ , * ? ? ? * ) enabled mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) observations with unprecedented sensitivity . \\n an enormous archive of imaging data has been collected using the infrared array camera  ( irac , * ? ? ? * ) and the multiband imaging photometer  ( mips , * ? ? ? \\n * ) instruments aboard _ spitzer _ that have been utilized to study astrophysical objects in the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \\n * ) and beyond . in particular , _ spitzer _ made it possible to study resolved stellar populations in the magellanic clouds  @xcite and local group galaxies such as m31  @xcite and m33 @xcite in the mid - ir . \\n although global galaxy properties beyond the local group have been extensively studied using _ spitzer _ \\n images @xcite , efforts to catalog individual mid - ir luminous sources in these galaxies have been limited . \\n there are a number of sources of archival _ spitzer _ data for nearby galaxies . \\n the _ spitzer _ \\n infrared nearby galaxies survey  ( sings , * ? ? ? \\n * ) made a comprehensive mid - ir imaging and spectroscopic survey of 75 galaxies , many of them within @xmath17mpc . \\n the local volume legacy survey  ( lvl , * ? ? ? \\n * ) surveyed a total of 256 nearby galaxies , including all known galaxies inside a sub - volume bounded by @xmath18mpc and an unbiased sample of s - irr galaxies within a larger , and more representative , @xmath19mpc sphere . \\n the _ spitzer _ \\n survey of stellar structure in galaxies ( @xmath20 , * ? ? ? \\n * ) collected data for @xmath21 galaxies within @xmath22mpc using the warm _ spitzer _ ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) bands . \\n while it is difficult to identify and characterize mid - ir point sources in the crowded and dusty disks of large star forming galaxies due to ir emission from interstellar dust , blending and background contamination , it is nonetheless feasible to identify and photometer mid - ir luminous stars in galaxies well beyond the magellanic clouds @xcite . in @xcite \\n , we used archival irac images of seven galaxies ( @xmath23mpc ; closest to farthest : ngc@xmath2 , m@xmath3 , ngc@xmath4 ( see * ? ? ? \\n * ) , ngc@xmath5 , m@xmath6 ( see * ? ? ? \\n * ) , ngc@xmath7 , and ngc@xmath8 ) in a pilot study to search for extragalactic analogs of the galactic object @xmath24carinae , taking advantage of the data made available by the sings and lvl projects , which led to the identification of an emerging class of evolved massive ( @xmath25 ) stars @xcite . \\n here we present photometric inventories of the mid - ir point sources in the irac @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath14 , @xmath26 and mips @xmath1 images of the galaxies studied by @xcite . \\n although we concentrated on galaxies with recent star formation , as only these would have large numbers of the short lived , very massive stars that were our primary targets , we also included the small , low - mass galaxy ngc6822 as a test for examining large numbers of smaller , lower - metallicity systems . \\n m33  ( d@xmath27mpc , * ? ? ? \\n * ) was previously cataloged by @xcite in the irac @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath15 bands , and by @xcite in the irac @xmath28 and @xmath12 bands . \\n point sources in ngc300 ( d@xmath30mpc , * ? ? ? \\n * ) and m81 ( d@xmath31mpc , * ? ? ? \\n * ) were cataloged by @xcite in the irac @xmath28 and @xmath12 bands . \\n the catalogs presented in this paper identify a larger number of sources in these galaxies than the previous studies . \\n _ spitzer _ point - source catalogs of ngc6822 ( d@xmath32mpc , * ? ? ? \\n * ) , ngc2403 ( d@xmath33mpc , * ? ? ? \\n * ) , ngc0247 ( d@xmath31mpc , * ? ? ? \\n * ) and ngc7793 ( d@xmath34mpc , * ? ? ? \\n * ) are being published here for the first time . \\n we use the same mosaics that were utilized by @xcite . for m33 \\n , we use the six co - added epochs of irac images from  @xcite that was originally created and used by @xcite , and the mips data retrieved from the _ spitzer heritage archive_. for ngc300 and ngc247 , we used the mosaics from the lvl survey @xcite . for ngc6822 , ngc2403 , m81 , and ngc7793 , we used the mosaics from the sings survey  @xcite . \\n we utilize the full mosaics available for each galaxy . \\n figure  [ fig : galaxies ] shows the irac 3.6@xmath35 m images of the targeted galaxies . in what follows , we describe our methodology ( section[sec : photo ] ) and present the point - source catalogs ( section[sec : cats ] ) . \\n in this section , we detail how we obtained the photometric measurements at various wavelengths and combined them to construct the point - source catalogs . \\n although the procedures followed here are derived from the techniques developed by @xcite and @xcite , there are some key differences , as we now carry out an inventory of all point sources rather than targeting a particular sub class with desired photometric properties .    specifically , @xcite searched for very red mid - ir ( @xmath36 ) sources near or at the detection limit of the first two irac bands , and therefore included in their primary source - list objects that were detected in the @xmath12 but not the @xmath11 image , as well as objects that could only be detected in the @xmath37 difference image but not in either of the individual images . \\n @xcite focused on the most luminous mid - ir ( @xmath38 ) sources with a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that is either flat across the four irac bands or rising towards the longer wavelengths , and therefore included in the primary source list all objects that had @xmath39 in any of the first three ( @xmath40 ) irac bands \\n .    in this work , we implement strict detection criteria by selecting all sources detected at @xmath10 in both the @xmath11 and @xmath12 images within a certain matching radius as point sources . \\n next , we search for @xmath10 detections of these point sources in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 images within the same matching radius . if no counterpart is found , we attempt to measure the flux at the location of the @xmath41 point source through psf fitting , and failing that , through aperture photometry . for the mips @xmath1 images , we only use aperture photometry due to the much lower resolution and larger psf size compared to the irac images . \\n finally , for all objects that do not have a @xmath42 detection at @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath1 , we estimate the @xmath16 flux upper limits . \\n the fluxes and upper limits are transformed to vega - calibrated magnitudes using the flux zero points and aperture corrections provided in the _ spitzer _ data analysis cookbook . \\n given this broad outline , we now describe the specific technical details of how we performed the measurements at the various stages of constructing the catalogs . \\n we used the daophot / allstar psf - fitting and photometry package  @xcite to construct the psfs , to identify the @xmath10 sources , and to measure their flux at all @xmath43 irac bands . \\n the different roll angles of the various _ spitzer _ \\n observations made it necessary to construct the psfs for each galaxy in each band independently . \\n next , we empirically determined the optimal radius to match the @xmath11 and @xmath12 source lists . \\n figure[fig : match ] shows the distribution of distances to the nearest @xmath11 source for each @xmath12 source in m33 . in this case , over @xmath44 have a match within @xmath45pixel . \\n the density of nearest matches falls rapidly between @xmath46pixel ( @xmath47 additional matches ) , while the number of duplicates increases ( @xmath48 duplicate matches ) , and then the distribution essentially flattens . \\n similar distributions are observed for the other six galaxies ( see table[tab : stats ] ) . \\n we therefore adopted an empirically motivated matching radius of 1pixel in order to maximize the number of matches for a minimal number of chance superpositions . \\n we used the iraf apphot / phot tool for performing aperture photometry at the point - source locations for all irac bands and the mips @xmath1 band . \\n for the four irac bands , we use an extraction aperture of @xmath49 , a local background annulus of @xmath50 , and aperture corrections of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 respectively . for the mips @xmath1 band , \\n we use an extraction aperture of @xmath55 , a local background annulus of @xmath56 , and an aperture correction of @xmath57 . we estimate the local background using a @xmath58 outlier rejection procedure in order to exclude sources located in the local sky annulus , and correct for the excluded pixels assuming a gaussian background distribution . \\n using a background annulus immediately next to the signal aperture minimizes the effects of background variations in the crowded fields of the galaxies . \\n we also determine the @xmath16 flux upper limit for each aperture location using the local background estimate . \\n ideally , flux measurements of an isolated point source through either aperture or psf photometry would produce the same results after appropriate aperture corrections ( in the first case ) and small zero - point offsets ( in the second case ) to account for flux underestimation due to psf fitting up to finite radius rather than to infinity . \\n we derive this small ( usually @xmath59mag ) offset for each image from the mean difference between the magnitudes of relatively isolated , unsaturated bright sources measured through aperture and psf photometry . for fainter sources , especially in limited spatial resolution images of crowded fields , the aperture and psf photometry measurements can vary significantly . \\n figure[fig : offset ] shows the differences between apparent magnitudes determined through aperture and psf photometry as a function of psf magnitude for the @xmath60 sources in ngc6822 and m81 . for the less crowded case of ngc6822 \\n , the two measurements generally agree for the very brightest sources in all four irac bands , with the scatter increasing for the fainter sources . \\n the same is true for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 images of m81 , but at @xmath14 , the scatter is much worse , although a sequence of bright sources with good agreement between the two sets of measurements can still be seen . \\n however , for @xmath15 , such a sequence can not be clearly identified . \\n we found this to be true for the other galaxies and m81 shows behavior that is representative of all the targets apart from ngc6822 . \\n mismatches between the two magnitudes are a good indicator of when crowding is significantly effecting the magnitude estimates , and in the catalogs we list the difference between the psf and aperture photometry magnitudes for each source .    because of these crowding problems , we do not attempt to fine tune the @xmath15 psf photometry measurements by applying the small linear offset , although we do this for the other three irac bands . for all irac bands , \\n we universally prefer psf photometry over aperture photometry , because psf fitting is more successful at extracting relatively fainter sources in crowded fields . by definition , \\n the nature of psf fitting is that it takes into account whether the flux distribution of a potential point source is consistent with the psf shape , and the degree of agreement or disagreement is reflected by a smaller or larger photometric uncertainty . rather than conducting a bulk accounting of all excess flux within an aperture , psf fitting measures a weighted sum of excess flux within a finite aperture . \\n this is significant for fainter sources in crowded fields that are often close to brighter sources . \\n psf fitting more accurately identifies the flux associated with such sources isolating the contamination from other sources as well as more accurately subtracting the local sky . on the other hand , \\n aperture photometry can significantly over subtract the sky and underestimate the source flux , or overestimate the source flux by failing to remove contamination from nearby brighter sources . \\n nevertheless , aperture photometry proves very useful for validating the psf photometry measurements at the bright end in all irac bands , for estimating @xmath14 and @xmath15 fluxes where psf fitting fails and @xmath1 flux where the lower resolution makes psf photometry infeasible , and for determining flux upper limits .    to summarize , we implement strict detection criteria by requiring a @xmath10 detection of all cataloged sources at @xmath11 and @xmath12 . \\n we then complement those measurements at the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath1 bands through a combination of psf and aperture photometry , preferring psf fitting over aperture photometry at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and exclusively using aperture photometry at @xmath1 . \\n for all objects that do not have a @xmath42 detection at these three longer wavelengths , we estimate @xmath16 flux upper limits . \\n in this section , we discuss the results of our mid - ir photometric survey . because we required a @xmath10 detection for each source at @xmath11 and @xmath12 , \\n the effective survey area for each galaxy is the overlap of the irac @xmath11 and @xmath12 image mosaics . \\n table[tab : stats ] lists the effective survey area , gas phase ( h@xmath61 ) star formation rates adopted from @xcite and the number of point sources cataloged in each galaxy followed by the number of matches at @xmath62 and @xmath46 pixel , duplicates between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 source lists , and the number of @xmath10 counterparts identified at the three longer wavelength images for each galaxy . \\n tables@xmath63 list the coordinates ( j@xmath64 ; ra and dec ) of the point sources followed by their vega calibrated apparent magnitudes ( @xmath65 ) , the associated @xmath66 uncertainties ( @xmath67 ) , and ( for the @xmath68 bands ) the differences between the psf and aperture photometry magnitudes ( @xmath69 ) . for the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath1 bands \\n , @xmath70 implies that the associated photometric measurement is a @xmath71 flux upper limit , and @xmath72 ( as well as @xmath70 ) indicates that no reliable photometric measurement could be obtained for that location . \\n for the irac bands , @xmath73 implies that one or both of the associated photometric measurements did not yield a @xmath10 flux measurement . \\n figures [ fig : cmd16a ] and [ fig : cmd16b ] present the @xmath74vs.@xmath75 , @xmath76vs.@xmath77 , and @xmath78vs.@xmath79 color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for each galaxy . for comparison , we include the mid - ir cmds for all sources in a @xmath80deg@xmath81 region ( see * ? ? ? \\n * for details ) of the noao bootes field produced from the _ spitzer _ deep wide field survey ( sdwfs , * ? ? ? \\n our catalogs simply inventory all the sources present on the image mosaics and do not attempt to distinguish between sources actually associated with the galaxies and unrelated contaminants . \\n the contamination is significant for galaxies like ngc247 , which is highly inclined and covers a smaller fraction of the _ spitzer _ images , than for the larger and more face - on galaxies ( see figure[fig : galaxies ] ) . \\n indeed , the cmds of ngc247 ( figure[fig : cmd16b ] , second column ) clearly show two distinct population of sources , with the break appearing near @xmath82 . \\n the cmds of the two closest galaxies ( ngc6822 and m33 ) show distinguishable sequences of bright and red agb stars ( near @xmath83 ) , but for the more distant galaxies this feature is less prominent ( see @xcite for relevant discussion ) . \\n the cmds of ngc7793 has the fewest identified point sources both due to its lower mass and because of poorer quality ( more systematic artifacts ) of its image mosaics . \\n figure [ fig : mhist ] show the apparent magnitude histograms of all sources in the catalog , with the shaded regions showing the sources in m33 . \\n it is apparent that the m33 catalog is @xmath84mag shallower than the other catalogs in all bands . \\n overall , our source lists become significantly incomplete at @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 . \\n figure[fig : chist ] show the mid - ir color histograms of all sources in the catalog , with the shaded regions showing the sources with @xmath66 uncertainty in color @xmath89 . \\n it demonstrates the absence of any surprises in the color distributions and that the mid - color distributions are not due to large uncertainties . \\n all normal stars have the same mid - ir color in the first two irac bands , because of the rayleigh - jeans tails of their spectra , and we see this from the sharp peak of color distribution at @xmath90 . \\n the longer wavelength detections are increasingly dominated by dusty stars , with color distribution peaks at @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . \\n figures [ fig : mhist ] and [ fig : chist ] also show the apparent magnitude and color histograms of the sdwfs point sources ( dotted lines ) . \\n they show that our catalogs are @xmath94mag deeper than the sdwfs catalog and the mid - ir color distribution of blank - field extragalactic sources significantly differs from that of fields containing nearby galaxies . in particular , at longer wavelengths , the galaxies contain more red sources ( dusty stars ) while the random extragalactic field sources are generally bluer . \\n although we report the @xmath1 photometry in the catalogs , these measurements have limited utility due to the lower spatial resolution of this band . \\n the aperture used for this band commonly includes objects other than the intended target and is contaminated by emission from cold interstellar dust . \\n nevertheless , as we showed in figure5 of @xcite , the spectral energy distributions of the normal stars show the expected negative slope for the rayleigh - jeans tail of their seds between @xmath95 and @xmath1 . \\n the @xmath1 photometry can be very useful in specific cases , such as for studying evolved massive stars ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) , despite the resolution limitation .    where @xcite identified @xmath96 sources in m33 , and @xcite identified @xmath97 sources in ngc300 and @xmath98 sources in m81 , now we catalog @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 sources in these galaxies respectively . \\n this is due to a number of factors . \\n first , both of the earlier studies only cataloged the central regions of these galaxies , while here we analyze the full mosaics . \\n second , we use a larger matching radius of @xmath102pixel ( rather than @xmath45pixel ) to define point sources and a higher fraction of our cataloged sources can be coincidental matches between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 . \\n third , the catalogs presented here are deeper due to improved photometry and search methods based on lessons learned from @xcite . for example , @xcite noted that their m@xmath3 point - source list becomes incomplete at @xmath103 , while we reach @xmath84mag deeper for this galaxy and @xmath104mag deeper for the rest .    we have compared our m33 , ngc300 and m81 catalogs with the @xmath11 and @xmath12 catalogs published by @xcite and @xcite . \\n the photometric measurements at these two bands agree within the stated uncertainties for the brighter sources , with the scatter increasing towards the fainter sources . as is apparent from figure[fig : compare ] , we identify zero point linear offsets between the older catalogs and the measurements reported here due to calibration differences . \\n @xcite performed psf - fitting photometry and then converted the measurements to vega - calibrated magnitudes using simple flux zero point shifts derived from aperture photometry flux measurements of @xmath105 bright and isolated stars in each band . on the other hand , in this work as well as in @xcite , we perform the psf and aperture photometry measurements independently and then convert both to vega - calibrated magnitudes using the flux zero points provided in the _ spitzer _ data analysis cookbook . \\n this appears to have led to the @xmath106magnitude linear zero - point offset between the @xcite calibrations and our measurements for m33 . \\n the more subtle offset between the @xcite calibrations and the measurements we report here for ngc300 and m81 are due to the earlier work having used a background annulus far from the aperture ( @xmath107 aperture , @xmath108 annulus ) to measure the local sky brightness when performing aperture photometry , whereas in this work we use a background annulus immediately adjacent to the aperture ( @xmath49 aperture , @xmath109 annulus ) . in a crowded field , where a source is likely to be contaminated by flux from adjacent sources , an annulus far from the aperture \\n can underestimate the local sky . as the aperture photometry measurement \\n is used to fine tune the psf photometry to account for psf fitting up to a finite radius rather than to infinity , this appears to have caused the @xmath110magnitude offset . \\n we identified this issue previously and adopted the current practice of using a background annulus immediately adjacent to the aperture @xcite . \\n point - source catalogs of the inherently crowded galaxy fields that we are surveying are bound to be crowding limited , not just magnitude limited . \\n while figure[fig : chist ] empirically demonstrates that our source detection peaks at a certain magnitude and then falls off rapidly , it is likely that incompleteness is affecting even the bright - star counts , increasing towards and through the peak . \\n for example , @xcite suggests that even in a sparse field , incompleteness at the @xmath111 detection level can be on the order of @xmath112 . \\n ideally , performing an artificial star completeness test through addition of randomly distributed artificial objects in the images could be useful \\n .    however , the mid - ir bright stars ( massive stars ) are not randomly distributed , but in fact are highly clustered . performing an efficiency determination test through addition of \\n randomly distributed artificial objects in the images therefore would lead us to either overestimate or underestimate the efficiency . \\n for such a study to be truly useful , it would require a proper `` star -

       " {'article': 'different dynamical mechanisms are commonly invoked to explain the architecture of the outer solar system and extrasolar planetary systems . in the solar system , scattering of small bodies (  planetesimals \" ) by the ice giants \\n @xcite is thought to drive outward planetary migration and concomitant capture of pluto and other kuiper belt objects into resonance @xcite . \\n the effects of planetesimal scattering on the gas giants are smaller but still significant , for example in the  nice model \" @xcite where a divergent resonance crossing between jupiter and saturn triggers the late heavy bombardment . \\n the presence of small bodies around other stars can be inferred from observations of debris disks @xcite , but as yet there is no evidence for a dynamical role of planetesimals in known extrasolar planetary systems . at radii where tidal effects are negligible ( roughly @xmath3  au ) the eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets matches relatively simple models of gravitational scattering among a system of two or more massive planets that typically include neither planetesimals nor residual gas @xcite . \\n the success of pure planet - planet scattering models does not imply that other dynamical processes can be ignored . \\n the observed distribution of semi - major axes of extrasolar planets at small orbital radii requires the existence of an additional dissipative process @xcite , most probably gas disk migration @xcite , which will itself affect planetary eccentricity @xcite . at larger orbital radii \\n simple arguments suggest that a dynamically significant external reservoir of planetesimals ought to be a common feature of young planetary systems . \\n the formation of giant planets becomes increasingly difficult at large radii @xcite , and hence it is probable that disks of leftover debris surround the zone of giant planet formation in most young systems . \\n the typical masses of planetesimal disks are unknown , but values of 30 - 50  @xmath4 that are comparable to those inferred for the early outer solar system are plausibly typical , since they are consistent with disk masses estimated from astronomical observations of the youngest stars @xcite . \\n the dynamical effect of such disks on _ currently _ observed extrasolar planetary systems would be small , since radial velocity surveys preferentially detect planets that are either massive ( and hence largely immune to influence from planetesimal disks ) or orbit at very small radii where the mass of leftover debris is negligible . \\n pooling knowledge from the solar system and extrasolar planetary systems motivates consideration of a model in which planet formation typically yields a marginally unstable system of massive planets in dynamical contact with both a residual gas disk and an exterior planetesimal disk . in this \\n letter _ we ignore the gas disk and study the subsequent evolution under the combined action of planet - planet and planetesimal scattering . \\n we do not attempt to model the full distribution of extrasolar planetary properties ( which would require the inclusion of hydrodynamic effects ) , but rather focus on how planetesimal disks affect the final eccentricity of extrasolar planets at moderately large orbital radii . \\n we assume that the gas - dominated epoch of planet formation is sufficiently distinct from the subsequent phase of planet - planet and planetesimal scattering that it makes sense to study the latter with pure n - body simulations . \\n we focus on two large ensembles of runs . \\n the highmass set comprises 1000 integrations of three planet systems in which the masses of the planets are chosen randomly in the range @xmath5 , with a distribution , @xmath6 which matches that observed @xcite . \\n the observed distribution is derived from an incomplete sample that represents ( in the context of our model ) the distribution _ \\n after _ scattering , but these subtleties do not matter for our purposes . \\n the lowmass set is identical except that we sample a wider swath of the mass function between @xmath7 and @xmath8 . \\n the planets are initially placed in a marginally unstable configuration defined by circular , nearly coplanar orbits with a separation of 4 - 5  @xmath9 , where the mutual hill radius , @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the planets semi - major axes , @xmath13 and @xmath14 their masses , and @xmath15 is the stellar mass . with this spacing \\n the instability timescale is relatively long @xcite ( the median timescale before the first planet - planet encounter was 0.3  myr for the highmass integrations without disks ) . \\n our initial conditions are only a small subset of the architectures predicted from giant planet formation models @xcite , though broadly consistent with scenarios in which giant planets are captured into mean - motion resonances during the late stages of gas disk evolution @xcite prior to being removed from resonance by turbulent perturbations @xcite . \\n each integration is repeated twice , once with just the three planets and once with an external planetesimal disk whose inner radius of @xmath16 is 2 hill radii beyond the orbit of the outermost planet  hill radii between neptune and the outer planetesimal disk is needed to match the timing of the late heavy bombardment @xcite . \\n the spacing of 2 @xmath9 means that our models evolve on a somewhat shorter time scale . ] . \\n the inner edge of the disk lies within the radius where a test particle in the restricted 3-body problem would be stable , so the disk is in immediate dynamical contact with the outer planet . \\n the planetesimal disk is represented by 1000 bodies distributed between 10 and 20  au with a @xmath17 surface density profile and a total mass of @xmath18 . \\n we integrate these systems using the mercury code @xcite for 100  myr . \\n the integrator uses the symplectic wisdom - holman mapping @xcite for well - separated bodies , and the bulirsch - stoer method when objects are within @xmath19 mutual hill radii , where @xmath20 for our case . \\n planets were removed if their orbital distances were smaller than 0.1 au ( `` hit sun \\'\\' ) or exceeded 100 au ( `` ejection \\'\\' ) . \\n collisions were treated as inelastic mergers conserving linear momentum . \\n a large ensemble of simulations includes some cases that are much harder to integrate accurately than the majority . to make the best use of our computational resources we adopted a default timestep ( 20  days ) that results in accurate integrations ( as measured by the fractional orbital energy conservation @xmath21 ) for the typical case . \\n we then identified those runs ( about 10% ) in which energy was not adequately conserved and re - ran them with a smaller timestep . for runs without disks \\n we re - ran cases with @xmath22 with a timestep of 5  days , while for the runs with disks we re - computed cases with @xmath23 with a timestep of 10  days . \\n a small number of the re - run simulations ( typically 15 - 35 ) still did not meet our energy criterion and were discarded . \\n in the absence of planetesimal disks our model planetary systems are typically unstable on myr time scales . \\n there are also systems that are stable over the 100  myr duration of our runs . in our initial analysis \\n we _ assume _ that the typical outcome of giant planet formation is a system that , in the absence of a disk , would be unstable . \\n we therefore analyze the subset of disk - less simulations that are unstable , and compare the results to the matched set of simulations that include disks . \\n this is not a perfect one - to - one comparison , since the chaotic nature of the evolution means that disk - less planetary systems can display different instability time scales in the presence of even negligible perturbations . \\n nonetheless we _ do _ observe statistical differences between the evolution of systems ( with disks ) that correlate with the stability of the disk - free systems , and hence it makes sense as a first approximation to separately consider the results for stable and unstable cases . \\n the results of our disk - less simulations agree with prior studies @xcite . \\n scattering from initially unstable initial conditions frequently leads to the loss of one or more planets via ejection or collisions and sets up a broad eccentricity distribution @xcite . \\n scattering among equal - mass planets produces larger eccentricities than scattering of unequal - mass planets @xcite . \\n figure  [ fig : ecum ] compares the final eccentricities obtained from the unstable highmass simulations and the observed distribution @xcite of extra - solar planets . \\n they are in good quantitative agreement . \\n the eccentricity distribution from the unstable lowmass simulations without disks is shifted toward lower values @xcite , and fits the observed distribution of extra - solar planets with @xmath24 @xcite . \\n our model therefore exhibits evolution that is consistent with current observations of extrasolar planetary systems , which as we noted previously are mostly of systems at such small radii that planetesimal disks are dynamically unimportant .    at larger radii \\n we expect that both disks and planet - planet scattering will play a dynamical role . \\n a wide range of outcomes is then possible . \\n exchange of energy and angular momentum between the planets and the planetesimal disk leads to planetary migration @xcite , which can be either stabilizing or destabilizing . \\n a low mass planet adjacent to the disk scatters planetesimals inward , resulting in divergent migration that is often stabilizing unless resonance crossing excites eccentricity to the point of triggering instability . \\n alternatively , an outer massive planet interacting with the disk directly ejects planetesimals and migrates inward , compressing the system and leading to instability or resonant capture . \\n an equally important effect is that the disk can act to recircularize the orbits of scattered planets _ \\n after _ dynamical instabilities @xcite . to illustrate how significant recircularization can be we ran a small additional set of idealized experiments \\n in which a single planet with mass @xmath25 on an orbit with @xmath26 and @xmath27 begins to interact with our _ initial _ planetesimal disk . for @xmath28 years ( longer for smaller @xmath25 ) \\n , @xmath29 is damped roughly exponentially with a damping time scale @xmath30 , defined via , @xmath31 of @xmath32 years , independent of @xmath25 . \\n the subsequent evolution was highly mass - dependent : for low - mass planets , @xmath29 continued to decrease on much longer timescales ( 0.36 , 0.63 , and 4.6 myr to reach @xmath33 for @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , respectively ) . \\n massive planets disrupted the disk , halting dynamical friction . \\n the total decrease in @xmath29 for @xmath36 was 0.15 or less , corresponding to an increase of 1.5 au or less in perihelion distance . \\n figure  [ fig : evol9 ] illustrates the diversity of outcomes from our simulations that include planetesimal disks . \\n we split our simulations into three mass bins ( the solar system s giant planets fall into the middle bin ) and three stability categories . in \\n stable \" systems there are no close encounters between planets and no large - scale change in system architecture ( the ordering of the planets is preserved and all planets survive ) . \\n moderately stable \" systems experience substantial perturbations  which may be due to resonance crossing in high - mass systems or close encounters in low - mass systems  that are nonetheless insufficient to alter the architecture .  unstable \\n \" systems undergo close encounters leading to architectural change . \\n subsets of our runs show dynamics analogous to that studied for the solar system and for extra - solar planetary systems . at high masses planetesimal disks \\n stabilize about 30% of cases but planet - planet scattering leading to the loss of one or more planets is still common . \\n quantitatively , the median eccentricity is reduced ( figure  [ fig : ecum ] ) but many highly eccentric systems remain . \\n as planet masses decreases the dynamical importance of planetesimals grows . for low - mass systems , \\n the masses of the planets and the planetesimal disk are comparable and planetesimal scattering inevitably leads to migration . \\n divergent crossing of mean - motion resonances ( one example of which is shown in the center panel of figure  [ fig : evol9 ] ) can result in abrupt changes to planetary semi - major axis and eccentricity that qualitatively resemble those seen in the nice model @xcite . \\n we also see behavior that resembles an alternative solar system model in which uranus and neptune formed in the jupiter - saturn region and were scattered outward @xcite ( top left panel ) . at the lowest masses \\n even highly unstable systems rarely destroy any planets because recircularization of scattered planets is efficient ( top center panel ) , though re - ordering of planets is common . in summary , \\n dynamics characteristic of the outer solar system is common among low- to medium - mass planetary systems .    the main prediction of our model is the statistical distribution of planetary eccentricity as a function of planet mass . \\n figure  [ fig : mtot - e ] shows the distribution of the eccentricity of the innermost surviving planet as a function of the total mass in surviving planets . in the absence of disks we observe similar behavior across all system masses \\n the shift to smaller eccentricities for the lowmass runs , seen in figure  [ fig : ecum ] , is not visually apparent . \\n when disks are included , the eccentricity distribution divides into two distinct regimes : a low mass regime in which planetesimal dynamics dominates to yield low eccentricities and a high mass planet scattering dominated regime where planetesimals play a minor role . \\n for our specific parameters ( inner edge disk edge at 10  au , and a disk mass of 50  @xmath4 assumed to be typical for a stellar metallicity @xmath37 ) the transition between these regimes occurs for system masses @xmath38 . \\n we predict that systems whose giant planets orbit between 5 and 10  au , and which have a total mass below 1  @xmath39 , will typically have low eccentricity orbits . \\n this critical mass should scale roughly linearly with the stellar metallicity , as we expect the initial planetesimal disk mass to be proportional to @xmath40 . \\n we expect the same qualitative behavior even if the zone of giant planet formation extends to larger radii @xcite , though in this case the low eccentricity regime would only be observable further out . \\n although the eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets is consistent with the hypothesis that _ all _ newly formed multiple systems are unstable in the absence of disks , this conclusion may also be biased by selection effects . \\n most known extrasolar planets probably suffered significant gas disk migration prior to scattering @xcite , so the high incidence of instability may be a consequence of migration rather than formation . with this in mind we have separately analyzed those ( previously excluded ) systems that were stable in the absence of disks to see what impact disks have on them . \\n as expected , low eccentricity outcomes predominate . \\n resonances are also common : about 70% of all stable highmass simulations and 1/3 of stable lowmass simulations include at least one pair of planets in the 3:2 or , more often , the 2:1 mean motion resonance . \\n this is a much higher probability of resonance capture than occurs for pure planet - planet scattering without disks @xcite , and it also exceeds the fraction of resonant systems that are expected to survive the gaseous disk phase in the presence of turbulence @xcite . \\n most surprisingly within the highmass set a substantial fraction ( about 1/3 ) of stable systems become locked into mean - motion resonances that involve _ all three _ of the planets  analogs of the laplace resonance among jupiter s galilean satellites . chains of resonances . \\n roughly half of the resonant systems were deep in the resonance , with @xmath41 . \\n this fraction appears to be independent of the number of planets in resonance , as about 1/4 of the highmass resonant chains had @xmath41 for _ both _ pairs of planets . ] \\n arise preferentially in higher - mass systems and in systems where planetesimal - driven migration causes compression rather than divergent migration . \\n detection of high mass planets at the relevant radii ( between 5 - 10  au ) should soon be possible via astrometric or direct imaging techniques , and observation of resonant chains would be consistent with our model . \\n intriguingly , the recently - discovered triple planet system hr 8799 may be in a 4:2:1 resonant chain @xcite . \\n determining whether capture into resonance was initiated by a gas or planetesimal disk may be possible via detailed comparison of the outcome of resonant capture in planetesimal @xcite versus gas disks @xcite . \\n circumstantial evidence suggests that many observed properties of the outer solar system @xcite and of extrasolar planetary systems @xcite may be attributable to the dynamical effects of planetesimal scattering and planet - planet scattering . here \\n , we have studied the predicted architecture of planetary systems that results from the joint action of both mechanisms . \\n we have argued that this regime will be relevant once lower mass extrasolar planets are discovered at larger orbital radii than those currently known . \\n generically we predict that a transition to  solar - system - like \" architectures , characterized by near - circular orbits and relatively stable planetary separations , will be observed once surveys detect planets in the regime where planetesimal disks play a dynamical role . \\n our simulations suggest that the transition is a surprisingly sharp function of total planetary system mass , and that it occurs for system masses a factor of several larger than the initial planetesimal disk mass . \\n our initial conditions do not sample anything approaching the full range of initial planetary system architectures . \\n we believe that the existence of a transition between typically eccentric and near - circular orbits is a general feature of joint models of planet - planet and planetesimal scattering , but the transition mass and minimum orbital radii at which planetesimal effects become manifest is of course a function of the poorly known masses and radial extent of planetesimal disks . \\n our results suggest that the transition might be seen for sub - jovian mass planets at orbital radii of 5 - 10  au , but the transition would be pushed to greater orbital radii if giant planet formation consumes planetesimals across a wider extent of the disk . \\n we also find that the final system architecture varies substantially depending on the initial separation of the planets . \\n in particular , if planet formation yields a mixture of massive systems in initially stable orbits , interaction with planetesimals drives a large fraction of systems into resonance . \\n whether such systems exist should be testable in the near future . \\n we thank google for the large amount of computer time needed for these simulations . \\n s.n.r . acknowledges support from nasa s astrobiology institute through the virtual planetary laboratory lead team , and from nasa s origins of solar systems program ( nnx09ab84 g ) . \\n p.j.a . acknowledges support from the nsf ( ast-0807471 ) , from nasa s origins of solar systems program ( nnx09ab90 g ) , and from nasa s astrophysics theory program ( nnx07ah08 g ) .',\n",

       " {'article': 'the essential point of stochastic resonance @xcite is the following : if a stochastic resonator is subjected to an external influence , commonly referred to as the signal , its response exhibits signal features , which are most pronounced at a certain level of noise present in the system . \\n the fascinating aspect of stochastic resonance is therefore that , counter - intuitively , an increasing noise level does not steadily deteriorate the transmission of the signal through the resonator . on the contrary \\n , noise may rather be used to optimise the transmission process @xcite . \\n the implications of these effects are intensively investigated . in biological systems , for example , stochastic resonance apparently plays a role in the neural transmission of information @xcite . from a technical point of view \\n one might possibly see the emergence of a novel type of detector which incorporates an optimal amount of noise to perform best . in this \\n regard superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) have been studied @xcite . \\n they may be made to detect weak magnetic fields reasonably well without the usual costly shielding from environmental noise .    in recent years \\n it was shown that the performance of a single stochastic resonator can be enhanced , if it is embedded into an ensemble of other stochastic resonators which are properly coupled @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite : compared to being operated isolated the response of the resonator to the signal increases within the coupled ensemble . \\n however , if the coupling becomes too strong this response was found to deteriorate again . \\n thus in an ensemble of stochastic resonators the coupling strength turns out to be a second design parameter : apart from the noise level it can be tuned to achieve an optimal performance of the embedded resonator . \\n this effect was called _ \\n array - enhanced stochastic resonance _ @xcite . \\n it will possibly find technical exploitation and might also be relevant to biological systems , for example , coupled neurons . \\n the aim of the present paper is a further investigation of the phenomena related to array - enhanced stochastic resonance . to this end \\n we study a simple prototype system of coupled two - state stochastic resonators under periodic modulation . \\n the model we propose allows to analytically calculate the weak - signal limits of two prominent stochastic - resonance quantities , spectral power amplification ( spa ) and signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , respectively . following the concept of array - enhanced stochastic resonance \\n both quantities refer to the response of a resonator as part of the coupled ensemble . \\n the impact of the coupling on both response measures will be studied . \\n there is a close link of the present analysis to the work presented in @xcite and @xcite , which to our knowledge are the most comprehensive in the field . \\n however , compared to @xcite , where the spa of a system of globally coupled bistable elements was studied analytically , too , the present approach offers a more refined description , since it allows to avoid a mean - field approximation . \\n compared to @xcite , on the other hand , where the snr of a chain of locally coupled elements was investigated in a ( rather extensive ) simulation , the snr can now be obtained analytically . for a quick review of the results \\n the reader is referred to the 3rd and 4th passage of the summary section .    from a conceptual point of view \\n the model proposed here can be seen as an extension of the two - state model developed by mcnamara and wiesenfeld @xcite to study stochastic resonance in noisy bistable systems . instead of considering individual two - state elements as in @xcite these elements \\n are now arranged in a chain . \\n a simple next - neighbour interaction is introduced which brings the model close to the system studied in @xcite . \\n the interaction is chosen in a way that the resulting evolution of the elements is given by glauber s stochastic ising model @xcite . \\n a detailed description of this approach is given in the next section which also provides the necessary background . \\n we note that the connection to the glauber model is made for mathematical convenience . \\n we are not concerned with the observation of stochastic resonance in ising systems which was the central theme in @xcite and @xcite . \\n our purpose will also lead to the assumption of arrhenius - type transition rates of uncoupled unmodulated elements which is unusual in the context of ising systems . \\n first results of the present analysis had been published in @xcite .    a further interesting approach to arrays of stochastic resonators is c entered around a response of a more collective nature . \\n here stochastic resonance is studied in the summed output of @xmath0 resonators which need not necessarily be coupled @xcite@xcite@xcite . \\n recently , it was shown analytically that the snr of this output approaches the input snr , if a sufficiently large number of uncoupled resonators is used @xcite . \\n whether in some way coupling may still be beneficial for the collective response of the present model will be the subject of a future study . \\n only the summed output of a very large number of resonators shall be briefly discussed here . \\n it will be shown that in this case the snr always deteriorates under coupling . \\n this indicates that the coupling - induced improvement of the performance of stochastic resonators associated with array - enhanced stochastic resonance is a local rather than a global effect . \\n an early theory of stochastic resonance in noisy bistable systems with one ( generally continuous ) variable was worked out by mcnamara and wiesenfeld @xcite . \\n they studied the effect of a periodic modulation of these systems in a way which is independent of the precise dynamics involved . \\n to this end the behaviour of the bistable system was approximated by a random telegraph process . for simplicity \\n this process was taken to be symmetric , randomly switching between two states @xmath1 . \\n for convenience we shall consider here @xmath2 . \\n the probabilities @xmath3 to find the process in state @xmath4 satisfy @xmath5 and their time - evolution is governed by @xmath6    where @xmath7 denotes the rate of the transition @xmath8 . \\n these rates must be extracted from the precise dynamics at hand . to build a theory of stochastic resonance \\n they were assumed to be approximately given by @xcite    @xmath9\\\\ ] ]    with @xmath10 being the small parameter of the theory . \\n obviously , at this level the periodic modulation of the bistable system with ( angular ) frequency @xmath11 and phase @xmath12 is taken into account by the cosine term , only . \\n this simple model allows to calculate the long - time limit of the power spectrum of the random telegraph process averaged over a uniformly distributed phase @xmath12 . \\n the spectrum consists of a continuous part and a delta function at modulation frequency @xmath11 . \\n the continuous part of the spectrum is the lorentzian of the unperturbed process times a frequency - dependent prefactor . \\n the latter is close to 1 and governs the modulation - induced transfer of broad - band power to the delta peak in the spectrum . \\n from this spectrum mcnamara and wiesenfeld obtained their central theoretical result with respect to stochastic resonance : an exact analytical expression for the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the two - state process . \\n this snr is defined as the ratio of the weight of the delta function to the continuous part of the spectrum at modulation frequency . in view of the present work we shall neglect the signal - induced suppression of the continuous part of the spectrum and consider the linear response approximation of the mcnamara - wiesenfeld result with respect to the small parameter @xmath10 . \\n doing so one finds for the snr    @xmath13    if the approximation ( [ mwrate ] ) is performed on a particular noisy bistable system subject to a periodic modulation , the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath10 become functions of noise strength and modulation amplitude , respectively . \\n the dependence of the snr on the noise intensity can then be studied and the occurrence of stochastic resonance may be established for that particular system .    as an example \\n the overdamped double - well system was given in @xcite . \\n the model equation reads    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is gaussian white noise with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . using a modified kramers formula for the transition rates valid for sufficiently low modulation frequencies mcnamara and wiesenfeld found    @xmath19 { } \\\\delta = \\\\frac{a}{d}.\\\\ ] ]    the central idea of \\n the present work is to pass from the single bistable element to a set of coupled bistable elements by extending the two - state model of mcnamara and wiesenfeld . to this end \\n we consider a chain of two - state elements which for convenience is taken to be of infinite length . \\n if the elements interact the simple gain - loss balance ( [ mwmaster ] ) has to be modified to describe the evolution of the set of probabilities @xmath20 to find the chain in a particular configuration @xmath21 at time @xmath22 . introducing a formal operator @xmath23 defined for any function @xmath24 by @xmath25 \\n the new gain - loss balance reads    @xmath26    with the initial condition @xmath27 the @xmath20 are interpreted as the transition probabilities @xmath28 of a markovian process with infinitely many discrete components . \\n the statistics of the process is fully determined by ( [ master ] ) .    to introduce interactions \\n we assume that the transition rates ( [ mwrate ] ) of an element depend on the states of its next neighbours . \\n a simple choice for this coupling controlled by a parameter @xmath29 is    @xmath30,\\\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 is the mcnamara - wiesenfeld rate ( [ mwrate ] ) . with positive @xmath29 neighbouring elements \\n prefer to be in the same state , whereas they tend to be in opposite states , if @xmath29 is negative . \\n both tendencies grow with growing coupling strength @xmath32 . to avoid negative transition rates @xmath33 has to be required . \\n we note that the assumed type of coupling is thus able to model ferromagnetic - type interactions for which a coupling - induced improvement of the performance of stochastic resonators was found in @xcite and @xcite . for positive @xmath29 \\n the present model is particularly close to the model simulated in @xcite , since both are linear arrays of next - neighbour - coupled elements . for convenience we shall often use the terms ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic coupling instead of coupling with positive or negative @xmath29 .    of course \\n , other types of transition rates ( [ transrate ] ) could be considered as well . \\n the advantage of the present choice is that most of the relevant stochastic properties of the resulting model are already known . \\n they were studied by glauber who introduced this model as a stochastic form of the ising model @xcite . \\n ( we note that in the glauber model the term @xmath34 in ( [ transrate ] ) is replaced by a general time - dependent parameter @xmath35 . ) as in the mcnamara - wiesenfeld model it is again possible to find an analytical expression for the snr in leading order of the modulation parameter @xmath10 which is the subject of the next section . \\n the respective analysis is essentially an exploitation of glauber s work .    it may be possible to reduce the dynamics of some coupled systems to the two - state model given by ( [ master ] ) and ( [ transrate ] ) and hence to directly employ the snr formula derived in the next section \\n however , this approach is certainly more involved than the rate expansion ( [ mwrate ] ) needed to make use of the mcnamara - wiesenfeld snr . \\n we shall not pursue this more general aspect of the model in further detail . \\n instead we are interested in devising a simple prototype system which allows to study the impact of the coupling on the stochastic - resonance effect . to this end \\n we are looking for simple assumptions on the dependence of the model parameter @xmath14 , @xmath29 , and @xmath10 on some noise intensity and signal amplitude , respectively . \\n we proceed in two steps :    first , we retain the glauber s original relation of the present model to the ising model given by the hamiltonian    @xmath36    this relation is defined by an assumption on the probability @xmath37 to find the @xmath38-th element in state @xmath39 , if all other elements are fixed : in an adiabatic limit the @xmath37 of both models are to be identical . \\n this implies that    @xmath40    holds which allows to establish a relation between the parameters of both models . \\n one finds @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively @xcite . \\n the role of the noise intensity is thus played by the temperature @xmath43 . to skip unnecessary parameters we set @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the present paper \\n we assume that @xmath46 , which shall be referred to as the signal , is given by    @xmath47    for weak amplitudes @xmath48 this results in @xmath49 . \\n ( in section [ srsnr ] we shall also consider periodic signals ( [ forcing ] ) with an additional noisy background . ) \\n second , a plausible assumption has to be made on the temperature dependence of the time - scale parameter @xmath50 which is not effected by requiring ( [ detailedbal ] ) . \\n it is assumed that it retains the qualitative dependence ( [ mwparam ] ) found by mcnamara and wiesenfeld for the double - well system , i.e. , @xmath51 with properly scaled temperature @xmath43 . \\n this dependence is typical for many rate processes . \\n an appropriate temperature dependence of @xmath14 is also necessary to turn the elements into stochastic resonators for vanishing coupling . for simplicity \\n @xmath52 is considered . \\n the prototype system we are looking for is thus specified by ( [ master ] ) and ( [ transrate ] ) together with    @xmath53 { }    \\\\gamma = \\\\tanh \\\\left(\\\\frac{2j}{t } \\\\right ) , \\\\makebox[0.3 cm ] { }    \\\\delta = \\\\frac{h_0}{t}.\\\\ ] ]    we emphasise that this system is not an approximation of the ising system ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the same way as the double - well system ( [ doublewell ] ) is approximated by ( [ mwmaster]),([mwrate ] ) , and ( [ mwparam ] ) , respectively : the ising system and the stochastic glauber model are based on totally different dynamical concepts . \\n nevertheless the devised prototype system appears to capture in a simple way the essence of the effect of coupling and forcing on coupled continuous - variable systems like the double well .    to motivate this , \\n let @xmath54 denote the height of the barrier to be surmounted in order to escape from state @xmath4 . \\n in a very simple approximation the effect of next - neighbour coupling and forcing on the barrier height could be modelled as    @xmath55    @xmath56    comparing this to ( [ hamiltonian ] ) one finds that within this simple picture the effect of coupling and forcing on the barrier heights is the same as their effect on the energy levels of the ising model . \\n ( we note that for coupled double - well systems the chosen approximation would only hold for weak coupling . for strong coupling the systems \\n may no longer be bistable and the entire concept of a simple - minded two - state approximation breaks down . )    within an adiabatic limit and with some noise strength @xmath43 the transition rate @xmath57 of the barrier system would roughly read    @xmath58    from here rates of the form ( [ transrate ] ) together with parameters ( [ params ] ) can be obtained in two steps . \\n first , the factor related to @xmath59 is kept as the parameter @xmath14 with a respective choice of @xmath59 . \\n second , the factor related to @xmath60 , which describes the effect of forcing and coupling , is replaced by the respective term of ( [ transrate ] ) , which is easier to handle . a connection between both types of rates is again made by requiring that they lead to identical stationary distributions in the sense of ( [ detailedbal ] ) . \\n a particular close relation between the glauber - dynamics model and the barrier system should thus arise within the regime of quasistatic response . \\n nevertheless we shall not restrict the following investigation of the simple prototype system to the quasistatic regime . whether or not the suggested model provides insights which are also relevant to more realistic settings and possibly helpful in the design of coupled stochastic resonators \\n remains to be seen . \\n the aim of this section is to calculate the snr of the response of a two - state element embedded into the chain of coupled elements given by ( [ master ] ) and ( [ transrate ] ) . \\n this calculation will be done in terms of the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath29 , and @xmath10 and is essentially based on glauber s work . \\n we shall only take account of terms in leading order of the modulation amplitude @xmath10 . \\n the resulting snr will then be an extension of the simplified mcnamara - wiesenfeld result ( [ mwsnr ] ) . at the end of the section the general result will be applied to the prototype system specified by ( [ params ] ) . \\n in addition to the snr we shall also give an analytical expression for the so - called spectral power amplification ( spa ) . \\n following glauber we start by calculating the averages @xmath61 . from ( [ master ] ) one derives @xmath62 . \\n it results in    @xmath63 \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\ & & +   \\\\left[1 -

time - limit set of equations can be further simplified . \\n since all elements are forced uniformly , a particular element can not be distinguished from any other , once the initial distribution has been forgotten . \\n hence , all elements will have identical statistics and the indices in ( [ mean ] ) can be skipped . together with the previous assumption one \\n obtains    @xmath70    obviously , the long - time dynamics of the average @xmath71 is identical to the long - time dynamics of the average of an uncoupled element with rescaled relaxation rate @xmath72 and rescaled modulation term @xmath73 . \\n the resulting long - time limit of the averaged state simply reads @xmath74 @xmath75 { } \\\\tan \\\\psi = - \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\alpha(1-\\\\gamma)},\\\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 is the response to static signals @xmath77 :    @xmath78    formally this static response might even exceed @xmath79 . \\n we conclude that in this case @xmath10 is not sufficiently small and the linearisation of ( [ mean ] ) is no longer justified . later on it \\n will be shown that this does not amount to a considerable restriction . \\n the power spectrum of an element is determined from the average @xmath80 . like in @xcite \\n its @xmath22-dependence is removed by averaging @xmath81 over an uniformly distributed initial phase @xmath12 of the modulation term in ( [ transrate ] ) . introducing the correlation function @xmath82 [ \\\\sigma_k(t+\\\\tau)-\\\\langle \\\\sigma_k(t+\\\\tau ) \\\\rangle ] \\\\rangle $ ] \\n one finds    @xmath83    the second term on the r.h.s \\n . contributes a delta function with weight @xmath84 at signal frequency @xmath11 to the ( one - sided ) power spectrum as defined below . \\n the first term , on the other hand , forms the continuous part of the spectrum .    for the purpose of calculating the snr in leading order of the modulation amplitude \\n @xmath10 it is sufficient to approximate this continuous part by the power spectrum of the unperturbed model . \\n this implies that we neglect any possible signal - induced transformation of the continuous part of the spectrum as we did to obtain the simplified mcnamara - wiesenfeld result ( [ mwsnr ] ) . for the unperturbed model the long - time correlation function @xmath85 is not effected by the average @xmath81 . \\n it also no longer depends on the index of the element . \\n according to glauber @xmath85 reads    @xmath86    with modified bessel functions @xmath87 . using the relation @xcite    @xmath88    which holds for @xmath89 and @xmath90 \\n the power spectrum @xmath91 is calculated . \\n for the one - sided spectrum defined by @xmath92 at @xmath93 we eventually obtain    @xmath94    with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    now the snr of the response of a two - state element embedded into the chain can be calculated , which is the central result of this section . \\n it reads    @xmath97    for vanishing coupling it reduces to the simplified mcnamara - wiesenfeld result ( [ mwsnr ] ) . \\n in addition to the effect of the coupling on the snr we also wish to study its impact on the delta peak in the power spectrum . in this regard the spectral power amplification ( spa ) is a convenient measure ( cf . \\n e.g. jung in @xcite ) . \\n it is defined as the ratio of power contained in the signal peaks of output to input spectrum , i.e. , the ratio of the weights of the respective delta functions . \\n because of its dependence on the input spectrum the spa depends on the precise dynamics to be modelled by the two - state chain .    for the prototype system specified by ( [ params ] ) the spa reads @xmath98 , or explicitly    @xmath99    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the spa of static signals . obviously , the spa does no longer depend on the signal amplitude @xmath102 . for convenience \\n we also remove the @xmath102-dependence of the snr by considering    @xmath103    for the prototype system the parameter @xmath104 involved in the unperturbed spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) simplifies to @xmath105 @xcite .    both quantities , \\n spa ( [ spa ] ) and rescaled snr ( [ snr ] ) , only depend on three parameters : temperature @xmath43 , coupling strength @xmath106 , and signal frequency @xmath11 . \\n restrictions arise from @xmath48 , which lead to a simple expression for @xmath10 , as well as from the linearisation of ( [ mean ] ) , which results in an upper bound on @xmath10 as discussed in connection with ( [ meanstatic ] ) . \\n together one finds    @xmath107    it implies that finite @xmath102 place a lower bound on @xmath43 and an upper bound on @xmath106 . \\n however , these restrictions are rather weak : @xmath102 can be made arbitrarily small because its size is immaterial within the present weak - signal approximation . \\n we are now in a position to study the impact of the coupling on the response measures spa and snr of a single resonator embedded into the chain \\n . this will be the subject of the following two sections . \\n the spa ( [ spa ] ) has an unique maximum over temperature @xmath43 and coupling parameter @xmath106 for any time - dependent signal ( [ forcing ] ) . \\n the maximum spa is obtained for a frequency - dependent value @xmath108 which is always positive . in other words : a properly tuned ferromagnetic - type coupling yields the best spa performance of the two - state resonator element which is embedded into the chain .    for our simple model \\n this maximum can be studied analytically . \\n the partial derivatives of the spa with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath106 are found to vanish at pairs @xmath109 given by    @xmath110    and    @xmath111    respectively . \\n for @xmath108 to be real and finite , @xmath112 has to hold . with this restriction ( [ simple2 ] ) \\n has a unique solution @xmath113 for any given @xmath114 . \\n the corresponding @xmath108 is found via ( [ simple ] ) . within the given range of @xmath115 one \\n can easily check on ( [ simple ] ) that @xmath108 is indeed always positive . \\n an inspection of the second derivatives of the spa finally reveals that there is a maximum at @xmath109 . \\n its peak value is implicitly given by    @xmath116    from ( [ simple ] ) , ( [ simple2 ] ) , and ( [ spamax ] ) the following features of the maximum can be derived which are shown in fig.1 : tuning the signal frequency @xmath11 from very large to vanishing small values the temperature @xmath115 falls from @xmath117 to @xmath118 . at the same time , the coupling strength @xmath108 as well as the peak height @xmath119 increase from vanishing small to very large values . \\n in addition , an analysis of the curvatures @xmath120 and @xmath121 , both expressed in terms of @xmath115 , shows that the sharpness of the maximum grows as its height increases . \\n this indicates that to achieve optimal performance the system parameters @xmath43 and @xmath106 have to be tuned with increasing accuracy as the signal frequency decreases . \\n fig.1 also includes a comparison to the spa of an uncoupled element . at given @xmath114 \\n this spa has a maximum located at a temperature @xmath122 , implicitly given by    @xmath123    on the interval @xmath124 , whereby its peak value is found to be @xmath125 . \\n it can be shown from ( [ simple2 ] ) and ( [ simple3 ] ) that @xmath115 always exceeds @xmath122 . \\n the fact that @xmath108 was found to be never zero also implies that @xmath119 always exceeds @xmath126 . \\n however , looking at fig.1 it is obvious that at frequencies @xmath127 both compared quantities of the coupled element approach those of the uncoupled one and @xmath108 approaches zero . \\n the coupling - induced increase in the spa is thus vanishingly small at sufficiently high frequencies of the signal . \\n this comparison allows to distinguish between two different types of spa behaviour : at low frequencies the spa is enhanced under ferromagnetic coupling whereas at high frequencies it is basicly not , although a tiny increase still occurs . \\n both situations are illustrated at selected frequencies in fig.2 and fig.3 , respectively . \\n the low frequency spa exactly reproduces the qualitative effect found analytically by jung et al . \\n @xcite in a system of globally interacting elements . \\n the high frequency behaviour , on the other hand , where the spa does practically not increase under coupling , has to our knowledge not been reported before .    in both cases fig.2 and fig.3 \\n clearly demonstrate that at fixed coupling parameter @xmath106 stochastic resonance occurs : the spa has a maximum over temperature @xmath43 which , unfortunately , can not be established analytically . \\n fig.2(bottom ) shows that while ferromagnetic coupling improves the spa at any fixed temperature @xmath43 this improvement is lost , if the coupling becomes too strong . \\n there is thus an optimal coupling strength @xmath128 for every given temperature , which can even be exactly calculated at any @xmath114 . \\n one finds    @xmath129    which is always positive . \\n since the spa does not have a further extremum over @xmath106 , it implies that antiferromagnetic coupling always decreases the spa . \\n moreover , @xmath128 increases with growing temperature t and decreases as the signal frequency grows . in fig.2 the spa at the optimal coupling strength is included ( dash - dotted curves ) . in fig.3(bottom ) , where the high - frequency spa is illustrated , the coupling - induced improvement of the spa is hardly detectable and @xmath128 is almost zero .    considering the spa of time - independent signals ( @xmath130 ) given by ( [ spa_static ] ) \\n one finds that it has a maximum over temperature for antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath131 , only , whereby it decreases as the coupling strength @xmath132 grows . for @xmath133 \\n the spa increases with increasing @xmath106 as well as with decreasing @xmath43 . \\n it formally diverges for @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively . in both cases \\n the weak - signal limit ( [ range ] ) breaks down .    in general , \\n the spa ( [ spa ] ) is given by its static value ( [ spa_static ] ) times a dynamical factor @xmath136 ( cf.([meanresult ] ) ) . here \\n @xmath137 is the ratio @xmath138 of signal frequency to long - time relaxation rate , which also governs the phase shift @xmath139 in ( [ meanresult ] ) . \\n with growing @xmath137 the elements gradually loose their ability to follow the signal : the spa weakens and the phase shift grows . \\n this effect occurs , for example , if the signal frequency @xmath11 increases . \\n subsequently , the spa decreases with growing @xmath11 . \\n the impact of @xmath137 is also responsible for the occurrence of stochastic resonance and optimal coupling in the spa . here \\n a decrease of the long - time relaxation rate @xmath72 plays the crucial role : the elements dynamics slows down as @xmath106 increases or as @xmath43 decreases . \\n thus this slow - down occurs whenever the static spa grows . \\n hence , the dynamical factor always counteracts the static spa as @xmath43 or @xmath106 is changed . \\n eventually , the increase of the monotonous static spa is outperformed by the decrease of the dynamical factor which results into a maximum of the spa over @xmath43 and @xmath106 , respectively . \\n in other words , stochastic resonance and optimal coupling occur .    as illustrated in fig.2 \\n the spa can be seen as a transition between two limits , the static spa given by @xmath140 ( @xmath141 , dashed curves ) and @xmath142 ( @xmath143 , dotted curves ) , respectively . since both limits intersect at @xmath144 , i.e. at @xmath145 , the plots nicely show the well - known approximate matching of time scales at the spa peak . \\n this matching does not only occur over @xmath43 ( fig.2 , top ) , but over @xmath106 ( fig.2 , bottom ) , too . \\n if the signal frequency is changed , the peaks of the spa shift whereby all curves share the static spa as a limit . \\n this results into the qualitative frequency dependence found by mcnamara and wiesenfeld for the delta function part of the spectrum of the double - well system ( [ doublewell ] ) .    roughly speaking \\n , an improvement of the spa under ferromagnetic coupling only occurs at @xmath146 , where the impact of the static spa is not yet outperformed by the dynamical factor . \\n this explains why there is no improvement at signal frequencies @xmath147 : since under ferromagnetic coupling @xmath148 holds , @xmath146 can not be fulfilled in this case . at @xmath149 ( fig.3 ) \\n the spa is already within line width of the limit @xmath150 , where the impact of the dynamical factor prevails . \\n this limit is basicly given by the modulation term in ( [ simplemean ] ) . \\n its non - monotonous temperature dependence is known to be no longer associated with a matching of time scales @xcite . \\n the static response , which is thus the origin of the coupling - induced enhancement of the spa , can be interpreted as follows . without coupling and for a given fixed signal the two - state elements prefer to be in the state of lowest energy ( [ hamiltonian ] ) or highest barrier ( [ deltau ] ) , respectively . since the signal is homogeneous , this state is the same for all elements . without a signal but under ferromagnetic coupling neighbouring elements \\n tend to be in the same state , too , although they do not favour a particular state @xmath151 or @xmath152 . \\n taking now signal and coupling together , both effects add up . the tendency to find the elements in the state favoured by the signal grows and hence @xmath76 and the static spa grow compared to the uncoupled case .    with antiferromagnetic coupling , on the other hand , \\n neighbouring elements prefer to be in opposite states . \\n this counteracts the effect of the signal and leads to a decrease in the spa . \\n finally , the decrease of the static spa with growing temperature directly follows from ( [ detailedbal ] ) . there \\n the imbalance in the distribution of probability between the two states , which dependent on the view taken either differ in energy or barrier height , decreases as the system heats up : the mean response @xmath76 weakens due to increasing fluctuations . \\n the investigation of the snr presented here basicly relies on numerical evaluations of ( [ snr ] ) . \\n an explicit calculation of the power spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) already yields a rather complicated expression which does not lend itself to a detailed analytical study .    at finite signal frequencies \\n @xmath114 the snr displays the same qualitative dependence on temperature @xmath43 and coupling parameter @xmath106 as shown for the spa in fig.2 and fig.3 , respectively . at low frequencies the snr is enhanced under ferromagnetic coupling whereas at high frequencies it is not . due to this close similarity we omitted the respective plots for the snr . \\n we note , however , that this similarity is by no means a trivial result , since the spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) is itself a non - monotonous function of @xmath43 and @xmath106 . \\n the low - frequency snr qualitatively reproduces the snr behaviour found in a chain of next - neighbour - coupled overdamped double - well systems simulated in @xcite . \\n it is the first analytical confirmation of this behaviour . \\n we note that this correspondence occurs although the simulation in @xcite was performed with strong forcing while the present model is studied within a weak - signal limit . as for the spa \\n , the high - frequency behaviour of the snr has to our knowledge not been reported before . \\n if the elements are not coupled , their snr ( [ mwsnr ] ) does not depend on the signal frequency . \\n this was already found in @xcite , if the signal - induced reduction of the continuous part of the spectrum is neglected , as ( [ mwsnr ] ) clearly shows . under coupling this frequency independence of the snr \\n for ferromagnetic coupling numerical evaluations of ( [ snr ] ) predict a decrease of the snr with growing signal frequency . only in the limit of low and high frequencies \\n the snr approaches constant values . in both cases \\n the snr formula ( [ snr ] ) simplifies significantly . \\n one finds    @xmath153    @xmath154    where @xmath155 is the simplified mcnamara - wiesenfeld snr ( [ mwsnr ] ) of uncoupled elements . \\n @xmath156 is the static snr while @xmath157 represents the leading order term of its high - frequency expansion . \\n fig.4 illustrates the typical qualitative behaviour of the snr as a function of the signal frequency . at various frequencies \\n it shows a set of snr curves over temperature @xmath43 and coupling parameter @xmath106 , respectively . \\n the dashed curves represent @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively . \\n the apparent fact that the snr decreases with growing signal frequency implies that its static value can not be exceeded at any other signal frequency . \\n then it follows immediately from ( [ snrlim1 ] ) that the coupling - induced enhancement of the snr possesses an upper limit : it can not be better than a factor four . \\n this is a rigorous result for the general chain model and not limited to the prototype system , where a special choice of the parameters was made . due to the simplicity of the chain model \\n this result may well reflect a limit of more general nature for the improvement of a weak - signal snr . \\n fig.5 shows the static snr over temperature @xmath43 . \\n it differs qualitatively from the static spa which according to ( [ spa_static ] ) has a monotonous behaviour .    turning briefly to antiferromagnetic coupling \\n one finds that the continuous part of the spectrum is insensitive to the sign of the coupling parameter @xmath106 . \\n now even the static snr decreases under coupling . as shown in fig.4(bottom ) it is found below the high - frequency snr curve , i.e. , here the snr increases with growing signal frequency . since at medium frequencies \\n again a transition occurs between both curves similar to the transition in fig.4(top ) , a second maximum in the snr over @xmath43 may emerge in this situation . \\n the investigation of the impact of the coupling on the snr can also be extended to the more natural situation , where the signal itself is embedded into noise . \\n the question to address is , whether the improvement of the snr , which was established for independent internal noise sources , can still be found with additional coherent external noise . \\n ( this problem does not occur for the spa , where only the height of the signal peak is of interest . )    to study this case it is assumed that the input spectrum consists of the previous signal peak described by @xmath158 and a noise part @xmath159 . within the weak - signal limit it was shown that the signal peak of the input spectrum leads to a respective peak in the output spectrum at signal frequency , only : no additional peaks at multiples of that frequency occur . therefore , any additional contribution to the continuous part of the output spectrum at signal frequency can only arise from @xmath160 . \\n in analogy to ( [ meanresult ] ) one finds that this additional contribution is given by @xmath161 \\n .    together with ( [ snr ] ) the resulting snr @xmath162 reads , again in units of @xmath163 , @xmath164 it can be expressed in terms of the snr @xmath165 ( cf.([snr ] ) ) and the input snr @xmath166 written in units of @xmath163 , respectively . \\n one finds @xmath167    @xmath162 is thus a steadily growing function of the previously studied snr @xmath165 , whereby it can not exceed the input snr @xmath168 . \\n ( the latter is a meanwhile well - known result of linear response theory @xcite which is in fact the limit we are taking here . ) \\n since @xmath168 is constant at fixed signal frequency @xmath11 , a coupling - induced increase of @xmath165 will lead to an increase in @xmath162 , too . \\n the improvement of the snr under coupling is thus preserved with external coherent noise . from ( [ noisysnr2 ] ) \\n one can easily show that the maximum enhancement of @xmath162 compared to the uncoupled chain reaches the previously found factor four for vanishing input noise , only . \\n in general , this factor is smaller approaching 1 , if the input noise is so strong that the input snr and hence @xmath162 go to zero .    at the end \\n we shall make a brief excursion to the collective response of the chain , which was mentioned in the introduction . \\n we consider the following sum which involves the states of @xmath0 elements :    @xmath169    it is not difficult to show that the spa of this new quantity is simply @xmath170 times the previously studied spa ( [ spa ] ) . for the snr , however , this new situation is completely different . \\n previously the continuous part of the spectrum was determined from the auto - correlation function @xmath171 of an element alone ( cf . \\n ( [ correl1 ] ) ) . \\n now this spectrum will involve cross - correlation contributions @xmath172 of different elements @xmath173 , too . \\n the new contributions to the continuous part of the spectrum change the qualitative behaviour of the snr under coupling . \\n we shall demonstrate this in the limit @xmath174 . \\n for this case glauber calculated the unperturbed spectrum @xcite which reads in its one - sided version    @xmath175    inserting this spectrum into ( [ snr ] ) , multiplied by @xmath170 due to the mentioned increase of the spa , one finds for the new snr per element @xmath176    which , of course , again reduces to the simplified mcnamara - wiesenfeld snr ( [ mwsnr ] ) for vanishing coupling . \\n clearly , the snr is now a decreasing function of the coupling parameter and the sign of the latter is no longer important . \\n hence , there is a drastic difference in the snr of single and collective response with respect to coupling . \\n of course , we have so far merely investigated the limits of ( [ global0 ] ) , @xmath177 and @xmath174 , respectively . \\n we expect that the snr of the collective response of only a few elements still increases under coupling @xcite . \\n a detailed analysis of the present model with respect to these collective effects will be the subject of a further investigation . \\n in this paper we extended the two - state model of stochastic resonance introduced by mcnamara and wiesenfeld to a chain of infinitely many coupled two - state elements which are periodically modulated . \\n the interaction of the elements was chosen in a way that the chain evolves according to glauber s stochastic ising model . \\n in analogy to the work of mcnamara and wiesenfeld and based glauber s results analytical expressions for the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and the spectral power amplification ( spa ) have been obtained in the limit of weak modulations . here \\n both quantities refer to the response of a single element as part of the chain .    instead of approximating the dynamics of a particular coupled system by the chain model \\n , we used the latter to build a prototype system which hopefully captures the essential features of an entire class of coupled stochastic resonators . \\n to this end additional assumptions were made on the dependence of the model parameters on some noise intensity and signal amplitude , respectively . \\n the prototype system was used to study the effect of the coupling on the response of a single resonator embedded into the chain . \\n the results show that array - enhanced stochastic resonance occurs for ferromagnetic - type coupling in spa and snr . \\n the qualitative features of the effects reproduce those previously found in coupled stochastic resonators . the simplicity of the chain model allowed for a detailed analytical investigation of the spa . \\n for the snr the observed effects have been confirmed analytically for the first time . \\n in addition , it was found that the improvement of the single - resonator response compared to the response of the uncoupled resonator still occurs , if the signal is embedded into noise . \\n for the snr this improvement was shown to be limited by a factor four which is reached for vanishing input noise , only . \\n a brief excursion into the collective response of @xmath0 resonators , on the other hand , disclosed that coupling can not improve the snr , if @xmath0 is very large \\n .    a closer look at the mechanisms behind the effects revealed that in the present model an improvement of the stochastic resonators under coupling is associated with the regime of quasistatic response . \\n since the model studied here possesses an upper bound to the time scale of its dynamics , the desired improvement is essentially restricted to sufficiently slow signals . for the spa \\n this improvement is based on a stronger tendency of the two - state elements to align in parallel , if signal and ferromagnetic coupling act together , compared to this tendency caused by the signal alone . \\n the reason why the improvement of the spa is lost , if the coupling is too strong , was found to be the slow - down of the system dynamics under coupling : it simply prevents the resonators from responding quasistatically \\n .          for review - type articles on stochastic resonance see , e.g. : + p. jung , phys . \\n * 234 * , 175 ( 1993 ) \\n . + f. moss , d. pierson , d. ogorman , int . \\n 4*(6 ) , 1383 ( 1994 ) . \\n + k. wiesenfeld , f. moss , nature * 373 * , 33 ( 1995 ) . \\n + a. bulsara and l. gammaitoni , physics today , march 1996 , 39 ( 1996 ) . \\n + l. gammaitoni , p. hnggi , p. jung , and f. marchesoni , rev . \\n * 70 * , 223 ( 1998 ) + a bibliography on stochastic resonance can be found at http://www.pg.infn.it / sr/.    j. k. douglas , l. wilkens , e. pantazelou , and f. moss , nature * 365 * , 337 ( 1993 ) . \\n + s. m. besrukov and i. vodyanoy , nature * 378 * , 362 ( 1995 ) . \\n + j. e. levin and j. p. miller , nature * 380 * , 165 ( 1996 ) . \\n + p. cordo , j. t. ingils , s. verschueren , j. j. collins , d. m. merfeld , s. rosenblum , s. buckley , and f. moss , nature * 383 * , 769 ( 1996 ) \\n . + j. j. collins , t. t. imhoff , and p. grigg nature * 383 * , 770 ( 1996 ) . \\n r. rouse , siyuan han , and j. e. lukens , appl . \\n phys . lett . * 66 * , 108 ( 1995 ) . \\n + a. d. hibbs , a. l. singsaas , e. w. jacobs , a. r. bulsara , j. j. bekkedahl , and f. moss , j. appl . \\n * 77 * , 2582 ( 1995 ) . \\n + a. d. hibbs and b. r. whitecotton , in _ applied nonlinear dynamics and stochastic systems near the millennium _ \\n , ed . by j. b. kadtke and a. bulsara , ajp conference proceedings , vol . \\n 411 , p.227 ( aip , woodbury , new york , 1997 ) . \\n a. bulsara , g. schmera , phys . rev . \\n * e47 * , 3734 ( 1993 ) . \\n + a. bulsara , a. maren , and g. schmera , biol . cybern . * 70 * , 145 ( 1993 ) . \\n + m. e. inchiosa , a. r. bulsara : phys . lett . \\n * a200 * , 283 ( 1995 ) and phys . rev . \\n * e52 * , 327 ( 1995 ) .',\n",

       " {'article': \"the composition and properties of matter under extreme conditions as they can be found in the deep dense interior of neutron stars has been a subject of investigation over the last six decades . \\n the large densities inside the star should be sufficient to bear new `` exotic '' strange components like hyperons @xcite , kaons @xcite or even to melt the baryons to form a deconfined quark matter phase . the appearance of such components may significantly change the gross structure of the star like its mass and radius .    since the pioneering work two decades ago @xcite the fascinating possibility of a deconfined quark matter phase in the interior of neutron stars has stimulated the work of many authors @xcite . \\n moreover , recently glendenning , pei and weber @xcite proposed that an observable signature in the timing structure of pulsars could even provide a signal for the existence of such a quark matter phase in the cores of pulsars . \\n neutron stars which are made of hadronic matter in the outer region , but possessing a strange quark matter ( sqm ) core in their interior are called hybrid stars . \\n the essential uncertainty for all theoretical investigations dealing with the question whether or not such phase exists , is clearly the equation of state ( eos ) from about normal nuclear matter density @xmath0 to the order of @xmath1 achieved in the center of the star . \\n so far , there is unfortunately no single theory to cover this density range with respect to quark degrees of freedom . \\n we therefore still depend on separate descriptions including the basic degrees of freedom of dense hadronic matter and quark matter , respectively . \\n the eos for the description of sqm in the framework of the commonly used mit bag model was recently improved by including medium effects @xcite . \\n this was done by using a quasi - particle approach , successfully used in various parts of physics . \\n the interaction of the quarks with the other quarks of the system is implemented by giving them density dependent effective quark masses . \\n this should lead to a more realistic description of quark matter going beyond the free fermi gas approximation . \\n we will refer to this model @xcite as the `` effective mass bag model '' . \\n it was found that medium effects increase the energy per baryon of sqm and therefore make the sqm phase energetically less favorable . \\n the physical reason for the larger energy per baryon is the increase of the effective quark masses in medium @xcite . \\n the scope of this work is to study the influence of these medium effects on the gross structure of non - rotating hybrid stars and on the existence of the sqm phase inside the star . in section [ effectmassbagmodel ] , we review the inclusion of medium effects in the eos of sqm within the effective mass bag model @xcite . in section [ hadroniceos ] , \\n we shortly discuss the used hadronic eos , before we come to the construction of the phase transition between quark and hadronic matter in section [ construction ] . \\n finally , we discuss in detail the results of the influence of medium effects on the gross structure of hybrid stars in section [ grossstructure ] . \\n the conclusions are presented in section [ conclusion ] . \\n the strange quark matter phase containing an approximately equal amount of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4-quarks ( sqm ) has been suggested as a possible stable or metastable phase of nuclear matter @xcite . \\n the eos of sqm is usually described in the framework of a bag model i.e.  as a non - interacting fermi gas of quarks at zero temperature , taking into account the bag constant @xcite . \\n quark interactions within lowest order perturbative qcd have also been considered .    in all parts of physics from solid - state physics to nuclear and high - energy physics @xcite , the quasi particle picture is successfully used to describe complicated interactions and collective effects like medium effects in many particle systems . \\n the particles of such systems are thought to acquire an effective mass by the interaction of the particles with the system . \\n adopting this quasi particle approach , recently medium effects were included in the eos of sqm in the framework of the mit bag model @xcite . \\n there , the quarks are considered as quasi - particles which acquire an effective mass by the interaction with the other quarks of the dense system . \\n the effective quark masses follow from the pole of the resummed one - loop quark propagator at finite chemical potential ( fig . \\n [ dyson ] ) which is calculated in the hard dense loop approximation @xcite . \\n one finds @xmath5 for the light quarks ( i.e.  @xmath2,@xmath3-quarks ) and @xmath6 for massive quarks with current quark mass @xmath7 ( @xmath4-quarks ) . \\n note that the effective masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 increase with the strong coupling constant @xmath10 and the quark chemical potential @xmath11 . \\n the effective masses ( [ defmq ] ) , ( [ defms ] ) are used in the ideal fermi gas eos at temperature @xmath12 . \\n the thermodynamic self - consistency of the eos is fulfilled in the sense of @xcite . \\n finally this corresponds to inserting the effective masses @xmath13 directly into the fermi gas expression for the one particle density ( where @xmath3 is the degree of degeneracy ) @xmath14 and extracting the pressure @xmath15 and energy density @xmath16 from the thermodynamic relations @xmath17 for more details see @xcite . \\n the overall pressure @xmath18 and energy density @xmath19 of the quark phase ( qp ) is the sum of the expressions for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4-quarks plus the corresponding fermi gas expressions for the uniform background of electrons . \\n a phenomenological bag constant @xmath20 is introduced in the usual way by adding it to the energy density and subtracting it from the pressure @xmath21 the bag constant @xmath20 is supposed to mimic the influence of confinement and corresponds to the energy difference between the perturbative vacuum inside the deconfined quark matter phase and the `` true '' vacuum outside . \\n it was found in @xcite that the energy per baryon of sqm increases with increasing coupling constant @xmath10 due to an increase of the effective masses ( [ defmq ] ) , ( [ defms ] ) . \\n this makes the qp energetically less favorable which  as we will see  will reduce the extent of a pure qp inside the hybrid star . \\n now we want to discuss the parameters that enter into the description of quark matter in the effective mass bag model . \\n the most important parameters are the bag constant @xmath20 and the coupling constant @xmath10 . \\n for the current quark masses we assume @xmath22 for @xmath2 and @xmath3-quarks and for @xmath4-quarks . \\n we have already mentioned that the phenomenological bag constant @xmath20 is directly related to the pressure @xmath18 which finally determines which kind of phase is realized at given chemical potential ( we will discuss this construction in detail in section [ construction ] ) . \\n the choice of its value has a strong impact on the gross structure of the star . \\n unfortunately , the exact value of the bag constant describing a quark system is far from being settled . \\n this is especially true in connection with a quasi particle model like ours which may lead to a smaller effective @xmath20 as in the case of a free model @xcite . \\n we therefore take @xmath20 as a rather free parameter and choose a value which is appropriate for our purpose to investigate the influence of medium effects . depending on the corresponding hadronic eos , \\n a too low @xmath20 ( e.g.  ) would prevent the qp ( medium effects neglected ) from being converted to hadronic matter , while a too large value would lead to a pure hadronic star . since in this work \\n we are mainly interested in the influence of medium effects on hybrid stars , we choose a bag constant of @xmath23 indeed , if we neglect medium effects , we will see that this value ensures the existence of a pure quark core while the star is surrounded by a pure hadronic region . nevertheless , we stress that different results e.g.  for the absolute values of the quark core radius can be obtained by varying the bag constant @xcite . \\n such variations will be systematically studied in a future work @xcite .    as a final remark , \\n we want to note that for our choice of the bag constant sqm in equilibrium ( @xmath24 ) is not absolutely stable with respect to hadronic matter as it was supposed by witten @xcite . neglecting medium effects \\n , we obtain an energy per baryon of @xmath25 which is clearly above the energy per nucleon in @xmath26fe . a larger bag constant or \\n the inclusion of medium effects will further increase @xmath27 ( see @xcite , fig . \\n the coupling constant @xmath10 which enters into the effective quark masses ( [ defmq ] ) and ( [ defms ] ) is treated in two different ways :    1 .   fixed coupling constant @xmath28 const . \\n [ gconst ] ) 2 . \\n running coupling constant @xmath29 . \\n [ grunning ] )    the first way is thought to study the influence of medium effects parameterized by a constant @xmath10 . since at @xmath30 \\n the quarks possess their current quark masses which corresponds to the free eos ( no medium effects ) , we can enlarge the influence of medium effects by increasing the value of @xmath10 . \\n the second way should include the behavior of asymptotic freedom by virtue of a density dependent running coupling constant .    in both cases we have to take the perturbative nature of the effective masses ( [ defmq ] ) and ( [ defms ] ) into consideration . \\n therefore , we restrict ourselves  for some convenience  to coupling constants @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) . as we will see , values of @xmath10 in this range do have a sizeable effect on the eos and therefore on the structure of hybrid stars . even at smaller @xmath10 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) \\n modifications to @xmath30 will be realized . \\n the applicability of results obtained in the hard dense loop limit ( see section [ effectmassbagmodel ] ) with @xmath10 taken in this range is discussed in @xcite for the similar hard thermal loop limit . \\n it was found that the use of hard thermal loop effective masses is justified from the following point of view . \\n the deviations of the hard thermal loop masses from the complete one - loop effective masses ( obtained without using the hard thermal loop approximation ) are indeed small and thus can be neglected in this kind of phenomenological models . \\n to describe the hadronic phase of hybrid stars , we use an eos calculated in the framework of the nonlinear walecka model including nucleons , hyperons ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) , electrons , muons and @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 mesons . since the first inclusion of the full octet of the lowest lying baryons by glendenning @xcite , such relativistic mean - field models are widely used for the description of dense nuclear matter @xcite . \\n since it is not the purpose of this work to study the influence of different hadronic models , we use a typical hadronic eos as an input and refer to @xcite for a general introduction into relativistic mean - field models and to @xcite for a detailed discussion of our particular eos and the underlying coupling constants . \\n we choose a compression modulus of . \\n the corresponding hadronic eos up to two times normal nuclear density will be shown later ( fig . \\n [ eos]a , most upper curve ) . for subnuclear densities \\n we use the baym - pethick - sutherland ( bps ) eos @xcite joined to the hadronic eos . \\n the bps eos mainly influences the low - mass behavior of the mass - radius relation . \\n it leads to an increasing radius with a decreasing mass , which is typically for a gravitationally bound star @xcite . \\n one important step in the understanding of hybrid stars was done by glendenning @xcite by realizing that a mixed phase ( mp ) of deconfined quark matter and hadronic matter inside a neutron star is not strictly excluded from the star as it was believed before @xcite . \\n such mp might have important consequences for our understanding of the observed pulsar glitch phenomena or the cooling behavior of neutron stars @xcite . \\n it is supposed to form a crystalline lattice of various geometries of the rarer phase immersed in the dominant one and probably exists over a wide range of densities @xcite . \\n the former predicted exclusion of a mp was owing to the `` freeze out '' of a degree of freedom , e.g.  by means of the requirement of charge neutrality in both individually phases . \\n this requirement restricts a degree of freedom which the system should originally exploit in its mp by rearranging electric charge between the two phases . every pure phase and a possible mp must of course be charge neutral but in the case of a mp this is only a _ global _ charge neutrality . hence , the quark and hadron components of the mp should still have the degree of freedom to reach their energetically favored  and possibly charged \\n state if only their volume proportion @xmath40 is always choosen to fulfill the condition of global charge neutrality @xmath41 here @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the charge density of the quark phase ( qp ) and the hadronic phase ( hp ) . \\n the volume proportion @xmath40 of the phases denotes the volume fraction @xmath44 occupied by the qp . if we do not allow the system to exploit this degree of freedom we will end up with a mp of constant pressure as it is e.g.  known from a gas - liquid phase transition in a familiar one - component system like water @xcite . since the pressure inside a star must fall monotonically from its interior to its surface , a constant pressure mp could not exist over a finite region inside the star . a construction of the first - order phase transition in the sense of glendenning leads to quite different results . as we will see below \\n , the pressure varies continuously in the mp with the volume proportion @xmath40 from @xmath45 ( pure hp ) to @xmath46 ( pure qp ) leading to a mp of finite extent inside the star @xcite . \\n following glendenning , we now write down the gibbs condition for the equilibrium between qp and hp . \\n to describe the qp including @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4-quarks and electrons , we initially have to deal with four chemical potentials ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) . since we require that the phase is in @xmath51-equilibrium , the weak reactions @xmath52 imply @xmath53 and reduce the four chemical potentials to two independent ones . \\n the chemical potentials of the neutrinos can be taken to be zero because they can diffuse out of the star . \\n for the remaining two chemical potentials we choose the pair ( @xmath54 , @xmath50 ) where @xmath54 is the neutron chemical potential which is related to the quark chemical potentials through the linear combination @xmath55 . \\n the same reduction is possible for the hp where we also end up with ( @xmath54 , @xmath50 ) . \\n @xmath56    at temperature @xmath12 the gibbs condition for mechanical and chemical equilibrium between the both phases now reads @xmath57 the pressure of both phases spans up a two dimensional surface over the ( @xmath54 , @xmath50 ) plane . \\n this situation is shown in fig . \\n [ phasetransition ] for a specific choice of parameters . \\n the two surfaces hp and qp possess an intersection curve mp corresponding to all possible equilibrium states of the mixed phase where @xmath58 holds . for every point on this curve \\n we can calculate @xmath40 by use of ( [ globalcharge ] ) to fulfill global charge neutrality of the mixed phase . from this \\n , the corresponding energy density @xmath59 can be calculated by @xmath60 hence , by starting with a point on the mp curve  which corresponds through ( [ pmp ] ) to a given pressure @xmath61  we can calculate the energy density @xmath59 to finally obtain the eos of the mp in the form @xmath62 . \\n the eos for the pure hp and pure qp was already discussed in the previous sections . \\n the pure hp is realized at a given @xmath63 if @xmath64 while the pure qp is realized if @xmath65 holds . \\n the pure charge neutral phases are given by curve a for the hp at low pressure and by b for the qp in the high pressure regime ( see fig . \\n [ phasetransition ] ) . \\n these curves are defined by the constraint of charge neutrality ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 for curve a and b , respectively ) . \\n the resulting pressure curve ( which finally corresponds to the complete eos for hybrid stars ) is therefore given by the white curve a - mp - b . obviously the pressure varies continuously along the mp curve and is monotonically increasing . \\n this clearly shows that a constant pressure construction is not even sufficient in the sense of an approximation . \\n we end up with an eos for hybrid stars which suggests the existence of a mixed phase over a finite range inside the star . \\n to investigate first the general influence of medium effects on the mass - radius ( mr ) relations and the structure of the stars , we consider @xmath10 in the next subsection as a constant parameter ranging from ( no medium effects ) to @xmath68 . in the following subsection we will restrict the parameter range by using a density dependent running coupling . to calculate the mr relation of the star we have to integrate the general relativistic equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for a non - rotating spherical star , the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation ( tov ) @xcite . \\n the eos enters into the tov equation solely in the form @xmath62 .      for constant @xmath10 the hybrid star eos obtained from the phase transition construction ( sect . \\n [ construction ] ) in the @xmath62 form is shown in fig . \\n [ eos]a for low and fig . \\n [ eos]b for high energy densities . \\n @xmath69    for every @xmath10 , the corresponding eos is divided into three parts . \\n these are  from low to high densities  the pure hadronic phase ( hp ) , the mixed phase ( mp ) of quark and hadronic matter and the pure quark phase ( qp ) . to distinguish the three parts , the region below the @xmath70 curve corresponding to the mp is shaded gray . \\n again we can see that pressure varies continuously in the mp . \\n as already found by other authors @xcite , the onset of the phase transition to the qp may already occur at densities of the order of the normal nuclear density @xmath71 mev/@xmath72 g/@xmath73 ( fig . \\n [ eos]a ) . a larger bag constant \\n @xmath20 would shift the onset to higher densities @xcite .    comparing fig . \\n [ eos]a with fig . \\n [ eos]b , it is important to note , that an increase of @xmath10 from @xmath30 to @xmath74 only slightly shifts the onset of the phase transition from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , while the onset of the pure qp is much more sensitive to a change of @xmath10 . \\n it is shifted from @xmath77 to @xmath78 ( fig . \\n [ eos]b ) . \\n this suggests that medium effects mainly influence the transition point between mp and qp while leaving the transition point between hp and mp more or less unchanged . \\n this finally leads to an enlarged density range of the mp . \\n one may now ask for the reason for this behavior . \\n there are indications that the small influence of the @xmath79 transition density on a change of @xmath10 is due to the fact that the transition density ( i.e. the density of the onset of quarks ) is below the onset of the hyperons in the hadronic phase ( which is typically between @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xcite ) . \\n this is obviously fulfilled from @xmath30 to @xmath74 in fig . \\n but the transition density @xmath82 of the @xmath74 result is just at the threshold of the onset of hyperons . indeed , if we further increase @xmath10 to say @xmath83 ( which is not shown in fig . \\n [ eos]a ) , we find that the transition density now strongly increases to @xmath84 \\n . we can get a qualitative feeling for this behavior if we look again at fig . \\n [ phasetransition ] which shows the @xmath74 calculation . \\n the point where the pure charge neutral hp curve ( a ) meets the mp curve corresponds to @xmath82 . \\n up to about this density , the chemical potentials of curve a basically increase in the @xmath50 direction which corresponds to a slight increase of @xmath59 . hence , \\n as long as the transition point for a given @xmath10 is on this part of the a curve , the transition density is rather insensitive on a change of @xmath10 . \\n this is the case for @xmath85 . at the onset of the hyperons ( especially of the negative charged @xmath36 ) \\n the electron chemical potential @xmath50 does not increase further and remains at roughly about @xmath86 mev . \\n now the chemical potentials basically increase in the @xmath54 direction corresponding to a strong increase of @xmath59 . due to the onset of hyperons the hadronic eos \\n is softened which shifts the @xmath79 transition density to higher values . \\n the influence of @xmath10 on this transition density is now comparable to the large influence on the @xmath87 transition density . \\n the latter is large because of an approximately constant @xmath50 of about @xmath88 mev ( see curve b in fig .  [ phasetransition ] ) . \\n therefore , one could say that the @xmath79 transition density is only slightly influenced by medium effects as long as there are no hyperons present at these densities . \\n let us now discuss qualitatively how this interesting behavior of the eos will influence the structure of the star . \\n for that reason , let us assume a star with a typical _ central energy density _ \\n @xmath89 of @xmath90 . at @xmath30 \\n this corresponds to a star of @xmath91 . if we look at fig . \\n [ eos]b ( @xmath30 ) we find that @xmath89 is on the right hand side of the ( dark ) gray shaded mp region which ends at @xmath92 . \\n hence , the star should possess a qp core . \\n following the star from its center outwards ( decreasing @xmath59 ) we obtain a large density region ( from @xmath93 down to @xmath94 ) where the star is in its qp . if we now increase the coupling constant to @xmath95 we see how the density range occupied by the pure qp is narrowed . \\n thus , the extent of the qp core is reduced . at @xmath74 \\n our assumed @xmath89 is not sufficient to bear a pure qp core . \\n the star has a mp core . \\n this is due to the strong increase of the @xmath87 transition density which shifts the onset of a pure qp to @xmath96 at @xmath74 ( fig . \\n [ eos]b ) . \\n such large densities can only be achieved in rather soft eos in which the gravitational force is able to compress matter to larger central densities . \\n this does not apply to our case of an increased coupling constant . if we look at fig . \\n [ eos]a we see that , in fact , the eos gets stiffer with increasing @xmath10 ( the pressure @xmath61 increases at fixed @xmath59 ) . \\n this implies that the _ critical central energy density _ \\n @xmath97 ( i.e. @xmath89 at the limiting mass ) decreases with @xmath10 . therefore , increasing the coupling constant leads to a strong increase of the @xmath87 transition density while @xmath97 ( as an upper limit of @xmath89 ) is decreasing . \\n this contrary behavior will  as we will see  lead to a surprisingly fast disappearance of a pure qp core with increasing @xmath10 . \\n a pure hadronic star can only be formed if the @xmath79 transition density exceeds @xmath89 . since for @xmath85 \\n this transition density only slightly increases with increasing @xmath10 ( fig . \\n [ eos]a ) we expect a star possessing a mp or a qp core .    finally , we observe on the right hand side of fig . \\n [ eos]b ( @xmath98 ) an almost similar eos of the pure qp for different @xmath10 . \\n the pure quark matter eos in the form @xmath62 is therefore only slightly softened with increasing medium effects as already found in @xcite . \\n our qualitative discussion of the eos and the resulting implications for hybrid stars will now be supported by solving the tov equation . \\n fig.[rm1 ] shows the resulting mr relations ( star sequences ) for various values of @xmath10 ( e.g.  g1 means @xmath99 ) . for comparison , the left hand side ( @xmath100 km ) \\n shows the pure sqm star ( strange star ) results , where we do not allow the quark phase to transform into hadronic matter . in this case \\n , the mr relation shows the typical @xmath101 behavior of a self bound star at low masses where gravity plays no important role @xcite . \\n it is only somewhat modified at larger masses where gravity terminates the stable range of the mr relation leading to a limiting mass ( mass of the most massive star of a mr relation ) . as already found in @xcite , we see that medium effects have only a slight influence on the mr relation of a pure sqm star . \\n this situation changes drasticly if we look at the hybrid star results on the right hand side of fig.[rm1 ] ( @xmath102 km ) . \\n with increasing @xmath10 , the mr relation approaches the curve of the pure hadron star ( denoted by h ) . \\n since the eos gets stiffer with increasing @xmath10 the eos can support a larger limiting mass with a larger corresponding radius . from the two different shaded regions denoted by qc ( qp core ) and \\n mc ( mp core ) we can see whether the corresponding central energy density @xmath89 of a point on a particular mr relation is sufficient to bear a qc ( @xmath89 has to be larger as the @xmath87 transition density ) or a mc . \\n the compact qc stars are located in the small vicinity of @xmath103 and @xmath104 km just below the limiting mass . \\n the top point of the qc region is reached if the ( with @xmath10 ) decreasing @xmath97 gets equal to the increasing @xmath87 transition density . \\n this is the case for @xmath105 . at higher @xmath10 , \\n the limiting mass of the sequence is reached before the central density is sufficient to develop a qc ( see e.g. g3 ) . \\n let us now follow e.g. the mr relation for @xmath95 ( g2 ) from low to high central energy densities @xmath89 . \\n at very low @xmath89 ( @xmath106 , compare fig . \\n [ eos]a ) the g2 curve corresponds to the h curve ( @xmath107 km ) . \\n the corresponding star is a complete hadronic star . with increasing @xmath89 the star develops a mc and the mass is increasing while the radius is decreasing . \\n at @xmath108 ( compare fig .  [ \\n eos]b ) the central density is sufficient to bear a pure qp in the center of the star and we enter the qc region . \\n finally , the limiting mass of the g2 curve is reached at @xmath109 . \\n we see that the largest parts of the mr relation correspond to stars possessing a mc . \\n only a small range of mass and radii corresponds to a qc star .    to discuss the radii of the stars and the extent of the quark and mixed cores in detail , we assume a canonical mass of @xmath110 . from fig.[rm1 ] we see that with increasing @xmath10 the radius increases from originally @xmath104 km to @xmath111 km . \\n such star possesses a qc at small radii below @xmath112 km , a mc at larger radii and a pure hp at @xmath113 km ( h ) . \\n this is due to the fact that with increasing @xmath10 the eos gets stiffer owing to a gradually growing impact of the hadronic part of the eos ( fig . \\n [ eos]a ) . \\n we can see , that inside such a typical star a qc or a mc is able to exist over a wide range of coupling constants from @xmath30 to @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) . \\n as already discussed , this behavior becomes clear from the only slight influence of @xmath10 on the @xmath79 transition density . \\n in all this quantitative discussions we have of course to keep in mind that the particular values of mass and radius obviously depend on the particular choice of the hadronic eos . nevertheless , we expect that by using a softer hadronic eos ( e.g. a compression modulus of @xmath116 mev ) a similar influence of medium effects should be found if we also soften the quark matter eos by use of an appropriately changed bag constant . \\n such dependence should be studied elsewhere @xcite \\n .    @xmath117    fig . \\n [ r ] shows the schematic view of the canonical @xmath110 star for different increasing @xmath10 . \\n the different shells correspond to the quark phase ( qp ) , mixed phase ( mp ) and hadronic phase ( hp ) . \\n we find that a small coupling constant of @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) is able to shrink the radius of the pure qp core from @xmath120 km ( with neglected medium effects , fig . \\n [ r]a ) to @xmath121 km ( fig . \\n [ r]c ) . already at @xmath95 ( @xmath122 ) \\n the pure qp core is vanished completely ( fig . \\n note that in spite of a completely vanishing quark core , the pure hadron phase has grown only moderately . \\n one could say that in a wide range of @xmath10 ( @xmath85 ) medium effects are not able to displace the qp in favor of a pure hp . \\n the essential effect is the transformation of the pure qp into a mp of quark and hadronic matter which therefore dominates the interior of the star . \\n this behavior can be understood from the strongly increasing @xmath87 transition density and the only slight impact of medium effects on the @xmath79 transition density . only for @xmath123 the phase transition to the qp \\n is completely suppressed ( fig . \\n [ r]f ) .      in this section \\n we want to use a running coupling constant in the eos of sqm instead of assuming @xmath28const . as we have done in the previous sections . \\n for this purpose we choose the phenomenological running coupling expression @xmath124 obtained by shirkov and solovtsov @xcite , where @xmath125 is the momentum transfer and @xmath35 the qcd scale parameter ( number of quark flavors @xmath126 ) . \\n this expression obeys the property of a universal limiting coupling of , while the familiar perturbative expressions possess a singularity at @xmath127 ( landau pole ) . \\n such singularity and the resulting large @xmath10 in the vicinity of @xmath127 is not applicable together with our perturbatively calculated effective masses where we want to restrict ourselves to @xmath31 ( see also @xcite ) . \\n since there are no clear results for the running coupling at finite temperature or density we take the zero density result ( [ rc ] ) and replace @xmath125 by the average three - momentum in quark matter @xmath128 for every quark chemical potential @xmath11 . \\n the quark chemical potential is typically in the range of @xmath129 mev which corresponds to @xmath130 for @xmath131 mev and @xmath132 for @xmath133 mev . \\n we end up with a density dependent running coupling @xmath134 reflecting the behavior of asymptotic freedom . \\n [ rm2 ] shows the resulting mr relation using the running coupling constant ( [ rc ] ) at various qcd scale parameters @xmath35 . \\n again , for comparison we show the pure qp results ( strange star ) on the left hand side ( @xmath100 km ) of fig . \\n [ rm2 ] , where we do not allow the quark phase to transform into hadronic matter . \\n the mr relation does not seem to be very sensitive to a change of @xmath35 from @xmath131mev ( l1 ) to @xmath133mev ( l3 ) . \\n this is depicted by the gray area . comparing the @xmath30 relation ( g0 ) with the running coupling results ( l1-l3 ) \\n we see that there is again only a slight influence of medium effects on a pure qp star @xcite . \\n it is nevertheless interesting to note , that the running coupling leads to a slightly smaller critical mass compared to the @xmath68 result in fig . \\n this holds despite the fact that @xmath134 does never exceed values of @xmath135 and should therefore naively lead to higher masses . the right hand side of fig . \\n [ rm2 ] ( @xmath102 km ) shows the corresponding hybrid star results . \\n again , we show the mr relation with neglected medium effects ( g0 ) and the relation for the pure hadron star ( h ) . \\n the running coupling results are located in a relatively small band just below the pure hadronic solution . at least at our particular choice of model parameters \\n , it should be difficult to distinguish between hybrid stars and pure hadronic stars by observation of the mr - characteristics of neutron stars only . \\n however , this situation can change if lower bag constants are taken @xcite . in this context \\n see also @xcite \\n .    comparing fig . \\n [ rm2 ] with fig . \\n [ rm1 ] one sees that the running coupling results are similar to the @xmath135 results . \\n the central densities of the stars below the critical densities are not sufficient to yield a pure quark matter core . \\n hence , the interior of the stars for @xmath136 km and @xmath35 between and consists of a mixed phase core ( mc , shaded region ) . \\n this is depicted for a canonical star in fig . \\n one sees , that the structure of the stars is only slightly sensitive to a change of @xmath35 . for ( fig . \\n [ r2]b ) we find a star ( @xmath137 km ) possessing a mixed core radius of . in this case \\n , at least half of the mass of the star is found in its mixed phase . \\n we have investigated the gross structure of non - rotating pure strange quark matter and hybrid stars using the effective mass bag model @xcite for the description of the quark matter eos . \\n this model is based on the quasi - particle picture where the quarks acquire medium - dependent effective quark masses generated by the interaction of the quarks with the other quarks of the system . \\n we found that medium effects described by this model and parameterized by the strong coupling constant @xmath10 reduce the extent of a pure quark matter phase in the interior of a hybrid star significantly in favor of a mixed phase . \\n for example , the radius of the quark matter core ( without medium effects ) of originally ( see fig .  [ \\n r]a ) is halved at ( , fig . \\n [ r]c ) and is vanished completely at @xmath95 ( , fig . \\n [ r]d ) . at the same time , the hadronic surface of initial thickness is only increased to ( fig . \\n so we found that the basic influence of medium effects on the gross structure of hybrid stars is the reduction of a pure quark matter phase in favor of a mixed phase . \\n for a wide range of the coupling constant ( @xmath85 , @xmath139 ) quark matter is present in the dense interior of the star at least as a mixed phase of quark and hadronic matter . \\n these results are confirmed by the investigation taking into account a running coupling constant . \\n there we also end up with a hybrid star dominated by its mixed phase ( fig . \\n our findings support the importance of the investigation of the complex structure of mixed phases . \\n lee , g.e . \\n brown , phys . \\n 79 ( 1997 ) 5214 ; + g.q . \\n lee , g.e . \\n brown , nucl . \\n a625 ( 1997 ) 372 . \\n + j. schaffner - bielich , n.k . \\n glendenning , talk given at 26th international workshop on gross properties of nuclei and nuclear excitation : nuclear astrophysics ( hirschegg 98 ) , hirschegg , austria , 11 - 17 jan 1998 , nucl - th/9802030 . \\n glendenning , s. pei , f. weber , phys . \\n 79 ( 1997 ) 1603 ; + f. weber , n.k . \\n glendenning , s. pei , invited talk at 3rd international conference on physics and astrophysics of quark gluon plasma ( icpaqgp 97 ) , jaipur , india , 17 - 21 mar 1997 . \\n v. goloviznin and h. satz , z. phys . \\n c57 ( 1993 ) 671 ; + a. peshier , b. kmpfer , o.p . \\n pavlenko , g. soff , phys . \\n b337 ( 1994 ) 235 ; + a. peshier , b. kmpfer , o.p . \\n pavlenko , g. soff , phys . \\n d54 ( 1996 ) 2399 . \\n klimov , sov . \\n jetp 55 ( 1982 ) 199 ; + h.a . \\n weldon , phys . \\n d26 , ( 1982 ) 2789 ; + h. vija and m.h . \\n thoma , phys . \\n b342 ( 1995 ) 212 ; + j .- p . \\n blaizot and j .- y . \\n ollitrault , phys . \\n d48 ( 1993 ) 1390 .\",\n",

    "in [ 18 ] tierney and vogel for any functor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a category with finite limits and with a projective class @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is an abelian category , have constructed derived functors and investigated relationships of their theory with other theories of derived functors . \n",
    " namely , they have shown that if @xmath1 is abelian and @xmath4 is additive , then their theory coincides with the classical relative theory of eilenberg - moore [ 7 ] , whereas if @xmath1 is abelian and @xmath4 is an arbitrary functor , then it gives a generalization of the theory of dold - puppe [ 6 ] . besides , they showed that their derived functors are naturally isomorphic to the cotriple derived functors of barr - beck [ 3 ] if there is a cotriple in @xmath1 that realizes the given projective class @xmath2 . \n",
    " the key point in the construction of the derived functors by tierney and vogel is that , using @xmath2-projective objects and simplicial kernels , for every @xmath5 from @xmath1 a @xmath2-projective resolution can be constructed , which is an @xmath5-augmented pseudosimplicial object in @xmath1 and which for a given @xmath5 is unique up to a presimplicial homotopy ( according to the comparison theorem for @xmath2-projective resolutions ) . \n",
    " a natural question arises about constructing a cubical analog of the theory of tierney and vogel . \n",
    " exactly this is the purpose of this paper .    before turning to the content of the paper itself , \n",
    " let us say few words about cubical objects and techniques . \n",
    " as it is well known , simplicial methods are developed for long time and are successfully used in algebra and topology . with less success , but still also cubical techniques have been developed , which was initiated on one hand by the systematic use of singular cubes in the singular homology theory of topological spaces ( see , for example , [ 14 ] ) , and , on the other hand , by the papers of kan [ 12 , 13 ] which have related cubical sets to homotopy theory . \n",
    " further research ( see e.  g. [ 1,2,4,5,8 - 11,16,17,19 ] ) has also shown that the cubical approach is interesting and important . \n",
    " cubical objects have a number of advantages compared to the simplicial ones . \n",
    " for example , a ( pre)cubical homotopy is given by a single morphism in each dimension , whereas a ( pre)simplicial homotopy requires `` many '' morphisms . on the other hand , \n",
    " significant disadvantages of the cubical technique with respect to the simplicial one are also apparent . \n",
    " for example , a cubical group , in fact even a cubical abelian group , can fail to satisfy the kan condition [ 16,17 ] . in the context of elimination of these and other disadvantages of the cubical theory , of extreme importance \n",
    " are cubical objects with connections introduced by brown and higgins [ 4 ] . \n",
    " these objects are cubical objects with extra degeneracies , called connections . \n",
    " to stress importance and naturality of cubical objects with connections it suffices to name e.  g. the following three facts . \n",
    " the singular cubical complex of any topological space has naturally defined connections . \n",
    " next , tonks in [ 19 ] has shown that any cubical group with connections satisfies the kan condition . \n",
    " finally , brown and higgins [ 5 ] have recently proved that the category of cubical objects with connections in an abelian category is equivalent to the category of nonnegative chain complexes in the same category .    in this paper \n",
    " we introduce pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections , obtained from the brown - higgins structure of a cubical object with connections by suitably relaxing their identities . \n",
    " projective precubical resolutions which we are using to construct cubical derived functors possess pseudodegeneracies and pseudoconnections and this fact is essentially used in the construction of derived functors defined by us . \n",
    " now let us list the contents of the paper by sections . \n",
    " in section [ prelim ] we recall the notions of presimplicial , pseudosimplicial and simplicial objects , precubical , cubical objects and cubical objects with connections , their morphisms , and the respective augmented versions of these notions . \n",
    " we also recall the definitions of normalization functors in the simplicial setting by moore , and in the cubical setting by wiatek [ 16 ] . \n",
    " furthermore we recall the kan cubical sets and their homotopy groups .    for any presimplicial object @xmath6 in an abelian category @xmath1 the normalized chain complex of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath7 in this paper , is a chain subcomplex of the unnormalized chain complex of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath8 . \n",
    " the well known moore theorem says that if @xmath6 is a simplicial object in @xmath1 , then this inclusion is a chain homotopy equivalence ( in fact this is valid for any pseudosimplicial object in @xmath1 ) . on the other hand , for any precubical object @xmath9 in an abelian category @xmath1 , one has the canonical inclusion @xmath10 of chain complexes @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath1 which are cubical analogs of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see [ 16 , 17 ] ) respectively , and which functorially depend on @xmath9 . in section 2 \n",
    " we introduce pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections and prove that @xmath13 is a chain homotopy equivalence for any pseudocubical object @xmath9 with pseudoconnections ( in particular for any cubical object @xmath9 with connections ) . \n",
    " thus we obtain a cubical analog of the moore theorem . \n",
    " then we establish some results which are not needed later on ; however they seem interesting by themselves . \n",
    " let us mention some of them . \n",
    " we indicate an alternative proof of the aforementioned brown - higgins equivalence . furthermore , we point out that this equivalence is realized by the above functor @xmath14 . \n",
    " next , we show that if @xmath15 is a kan cubical group , then @xmath16 , the @xmath17-th homotopy group of @xmath15 , coincides with @xmath18 , the @xmath17-th homology group of @xmath19 ( note that @xmath19 and @xmath18 are defined for any cubical group @xmath15 as well ) . using this and the cubical analog of the moore theorem together with the aforementioned result of tonks \n",
    " , we get that @xmath16 is naturally isomorphic to @xmath20 for any cubical abelian group @xmath15 with connections . \n",
    " let @xmath1 be a category with finite limits and a projective class @xmath2 , @xmath3 an abelian category , and @xmath0 an arbitrary ( covariant ) finctor . in section 3 \n",
    " we construct left cubical derived functors @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , as follows . \n",
    " first we show how to build for any object @xmath5 from @xmath1 an @xmath5-augmented @xmath2-projective precubical resolution , denoted @xmath24 , by means of cubical kernels and @xmath2-projective objects \n",
    " . then we prove the comparison theorem which in particular says that @xmath24 is unique up to precubical homotopy for a given @xmath5 . \n",
    " furthermore , it is shown that any @xmath2-projective precubical resolution @xmath24 is in fact an augmented pseudocubical object with pseudoconnections . \n",
    " we define @xmath25 , @xmath23 , to be the @xmath17-th homology of @xmath26 . \n",
    " besides the comparison theorem , the fact that @xmath27 has pseudodegeneracies is crucial in proving that @xmath25 are well - defined and functorially depend on @xmath5 . \n",
